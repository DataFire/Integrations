This means all request bodies must be wrapped with some metadata.\n\nEach request body must be an object with a `data` key containing at least a `type` member. The value of the `type` member must agree with the `type` of the entities represented by the endpoint. If not, a **409 Conflict** will be returned.\n\nThe request should also contain an `attributes` member with an object containing the key-value pairs to be created/updated.\n\n**PUT/PATCH** requests must also have an `id` key that matches the ID part of the endpoint you are making a request to. If the `id` key does not match the ID part of the URL path, a **409 Conflict** error will be returned.\n\n#### Creating a Node via POST Example\n\n    POST /v2/nodes/\n    {\n      \"data\": {\n        \"type\": \"nodes\",\n        \"attributes\": {\n          \"title\" : \"A Phylogenetic Tree of Famous Internet Cats\",\n          \"category\" : \"project\",\n          \"description\" : \"How closely related are Grumpy Cat and C.H. Cheezburger? Is memefulness inheritable?\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n\n#### Updating a User via PUT Example\n\n    PUT /v2/users/me/\n    {\n      \"data\": {\n        \"id\": \"3rqxc\",\n        \"type\": \"users\",\n        \"attributes\": {\n          \"full_name\" : \"Henrietta Swan Leavitt\",\n          \"given_name\" : \"Henrietta\",\n          \"middle_names\" : \"Swan\",\n          \"family_name\" : \"Leavitt\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n**Note:** If you PUT/PATCH to the `/users/me/` endpoint, you must still provide your full user id in the `id` field of the request.  We do not support using the `me` alias in request bodies at this time.\n\n#### PUT vs. PATCH\nFor most endpoints that support updates via **PUT** requests, we also allow **PATCH** updates.\n\n**PUT** requests require all mandatory attributes to be set, even if their value is unchanged. **PATCH** requests may omit mandatory attributes, whose value will be unchanged.",

This **MUST** be included with all create and update requests.\n#### Attributes\nThe properties of the entity.  Names, descriptions, etc.\n#### Relationships\nRelationships are URLs to other entities or entity collections that have a relationship to the entity.\n\nFor example, the node entity provides a `contributors` relationship that points to the endpoint to retrieve all contributors to that node. It is recommended to use these links rather than to filter general entity collection endpoints by IDs. They'll be faster, easier, and less error-prone.\n\nGenerally a relationship will have the following structure:\n\n\n    {relationship_name}: {\n      \"links\": {\n        \"related\": {\n          \"href\": {url_to_related_entity_or_entity_collection},\n          \"meta\": {}\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n\nIf there are no related entities, `href` will be null.\n#### Embeds\nPlease see the [embedding](#Introduction_embedding) documentation.\n#### Links\nLinks are urls to alternative representations of the entity or actions that may be performed on the entity.\n\nMost entities will provide a `self` link that is the canonical endpoint for the entity where update and delete requests should be sent.

Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.\n###Waterbutler API actions\n\nFiles can be modified through the Waterbutler API routes found in `links` (`new_folder`, `move`, `upload`, `download`, and `delete`).\n\n#### Download (files)\n\nTo download a file, issue a GET request against the download link. The response will have the Content-Disposition header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser.\n\n#### Create Subfolder (folders)\n\nYou can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the new_folder link. The ?kind=folder portion of the query parameter is already included in the new_folder link. The name of the new subfolder should be provided in the name query parameter. The response will contain a WaterButler folder entity. If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.\n\n#### Upload New File (folders)\n\n\n  To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's upload link with the raw file data in the request body, and the kind and name query parameters set to 'file' and the desired name of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the new file. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.\n\n\n#### Update Existing File (file)\n\nTo update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's upload link with the raw file data in the request body and the kind query parameter set to \"file\". The update action will create a new version of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the updated file.\n\n#### Rename (files, folders)\n\nTo rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the move link with the action body parameter set to \"rename\" and the rename body parameter set to the desired name. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.\n\n#### Move & Copy (files, folders)\n\nMove and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the move url, but with different values for the action body parameters. The path parameter is also required and should be the OSF path attribute of the folder being written to. The rename and conflict parameters are optional. If you wish to change the name of the file or folder at its destination, set the rename parameter to the new name. The conflict param governs how name clashes are resolved. Possible values are replace and keep. replace is the default and will overwrite the file that already exists in the target folder. keep will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new file's name until it no longer conflicts. The suffix will be ' (x)' where x is a increasing integer starting from 1. This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.\nFiles and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers. The resource parameter is the id of the node under which the file/folder should be moved. It must agree with the path parameter, that is the path must identify a valid folder under the node identified by resource. Likewise, the provider parameter may be used to move the file/folder to another storage provider, but both the resource and path parameters must belong to a node and folder already extant on that provider. Both resource and provider default to the current node and providers.\nIf a moved/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned. Otherwise, a 201 Created will be returned.\n\n#### Delete (file, folders)\n\nTo delete a file or folder send a DELETE request to the delete link. Nothing will be returned in the response body.",

Each endpoint will have its own documentation, but there are some general principles.\n\nNote: Assume undocumented routes/features/fields are unstable.\n\n#### Canonical URLs\nAll canonical URLs have trailing slashes.  A request to an endpoint without a trailing slash will result in a **301 Redirect** to the canonical URL.  There are some exceptions when working with the Files API, so if a URL in a response does not have a slash, do not append one.\n#### Plurals\nEndpoints are always pluralized.  `/users/`, not `/user/`, `/nodes/`, not `/node/`.\n\nThe only exception are the node and preprint citation endpoints, which are `/citation/`, not `/citations/`.\n#### Common Actions\nEvery endpoint in the OSF API responds to `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTION` requests.\n\nYou must have adequate permissions to interact with any endpoint. Unauthorized use will result in **401 Unauthorized** or **403 Forbidden** responses.\n\nUse `HEAD` to probe an endpoint and make sure your headers are well-formed.\n\nA `GET` request will return a representation of the entity or entity collection referenced by the endpoint.\n\nAn `OPTIONS` request will return a JSON object that describes the endpoint, including the name, a description, the acceptable request formats, the allowed response formats, and any actions available via the endpoint.",

The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a free, open-source service maintained by the [Center for Open Science](http://cos.io/).\n\nThe OSF serves as a repository and archive for study designs, materials, data, manuscripts, or anything else associated with your research during the research process. Every project and file on the OSF has a permanent unique identifier, and every registration (a permanent, time-stamped version of your projects and files) can be assigned a DOI/ARK. You can use the OSF to measure your impact by monitoring the traffic to projects and files you make public. With the OSF you have full control of what parts of your research are public and what remains private.",

Administrators on a parent node have implicit read permissions for all child nodes.\nAny users with write or admin access to the node are able to deauthorize an enabled addon, but only the addon authorizer is able to change the configuration (i.e. selected folder) of an already-configured NodeSettings entity.\n\n#### Returns\nReturns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated node addon, if the request is successful.\n\nIf the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.

      "description": "List of all the files/folders that are attached to your project for a given storage provider.\n####Returns\nReturns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.\n\nThe `data` key contains an array of files. Each resource in the array is a separate file object and contains the full representation of the file.\n\nThe `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).\n\n####Filtering\n\nYou can optionally request that the response only include files that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/files/osfstorage/?filter[kind]=file\n\nNode files may be filtered by `id`, `name`, `node`, `kind`, `path`, `provider`, `size`, and `last_touched`.\n\n###Waterbutler API actions\n\nFiles can be modified through the Waterbutler API routes found in `links` (`new_folder`, `move`, `upload`, `download`, and `delete`).\n\n#### Download (files)\n\nTo download a file, issue a GET request against the download link. The response will have the Content-Disposition header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser.\n\n#### Create Subfolder (folders)\n\nYou can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the new_folder link. The ?kind=folder portion of the query parameter is already included in the new_folder link. The name of the new subfolder should be provided in the name query parameter. The response will contain a WaterButler folder entity. If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.\n\n#### Upload New File (folders)\n\nTo upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's upload link with the raw file data in the request body, and the kind and name query parameters set to 'file' and the desired name of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the new file. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.\n\n#### Update Existing File (file)\n\nTo update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's upload link with the raw file data in the request body and the kind query parameter set to \"file\". The update action will create a new version of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the updated file.\n\n#### Rename (files, folders)\n\nTo rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the move link with the action body parameter set to \"rename\" and the rename body parameter set to the desired name. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.\n\n#### Move & Copy (files, folders)\n\nMove and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the move url, but with different values for the action body parameters. The path parameter is also required and should be the OSF path attribute of the folder being written to. The rename and conflict parameters are optional. If you wish to change the name of the file or folder at its destination, set the rename parameter to the new name. The conflict param governs how name clashes are resolved. Possible values are replace and keep. replace is the default and will overwrite the file that already exists in the target folder. keep will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new file's name until it no longer conflicts. The suffix will be ' (x)' where x is a increasing integer starting from 1. This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.\nFiles and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers. The resource parameter is the id of the node under which the file/folder should be moved. It must agree with the path parameter, that is the path must identify a valid folder under the node identified by resource. Likewise, the provider parameter may be used to move the file/folder to another storage provider, but both the resource and path parameters must belong to a node and folder already extant on that provider. Both resource and provider default to the current node and providers.\nIf a moved/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned. Otherwise, a 201 Created will be returned.\n\n#### Delete (file, folders)\n\nTo delete a file or folder send a DELETE request to the delete link. Nothing will be returned in the response body.",

The fork always points back to the original node, forming a network of nodes.\n\nYou might use a fork to copy another's work to build on and extend. For example, a professor may create an OSF project of materials for individual student use. Each student forks the project to have his or her own copy of the materials to start his/her own work.\n\nWhen creating a fork, your fork will only contain public components of the current node and components for which you are a contributor. Private components that you do not have access to will not be forked.\n#### Required\nThere are no required attributes when creating a fork, as all of the forked node's attributes will be copied from the current node.\n\nThe `title` field is optional, with the default title being \"Fork of \" prepended to the current node's title.\n#### Returns\nReturns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the complete srepresentation of the forked node, if the request is successful.\nIf the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.

The *original project* can still be edited, while the registered version cannot.\n\nRegistrations can be made public immediately or embargoed for up to 4 years.\n\n#### Withdrawals\nRegistrations cannot be deleted, but they can be withdrawn. Withdrawing a registration removes the content of the registration but leaves behind basic metadata. A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of information, namely, title, description, date_created, date_registered, date_withdrawn, registration, withdrawn, withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement. All other fields will be displayed as null. Additionally, the only relationship that remains accesible for a withdrawn registration is the contributors. All other relationships will return a **403 Forbidden** response.\n#### Returns\nReturns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.\n\nThe `data` key contains an array of 10 registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the registration, meaning additional requests to a registration's detail view are not necessary.\n\nThe `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).\n\nThis request should never return an error.\n#### Filtering\nYou can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter[title]=open.\n\nRegistrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.",

Attempting to retrieve a private registration for which you are not a contributor will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.\n\nAuthentication is not required to view the details of a public registration, as public registrations give read-only access to everyone.\n#### Registrations\nA registration on the OSF creates a frozen, time-stamped version of a project that cannot be edited or deleted. The *original project* can still be edited, while the registered version cannot.\n\nRegistrations can be made public immediately or embargoed for up to 4 years.\n\n#### Withdrawals\nRegistrations cannot be deleted, but they can be withdrawn. Withdrawing a registration removes the content of the registration but leaves behind basic metadata. A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of information, namely, title, description, date_created, date_registered, date_withdrawn, registration, withdrawn, withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement. All other fields will be displayed as null. Additionally, the only relationship that remains accesible for a withdrawn registration is the contributors. All other relationships will return a **403 Forbidden** response.\n#### Returns\nReturns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested registration, if the request is successful.\n\nIf the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.

The fork always points back to the original registration, forming a network of registrations.\n\nYou might use a fork to copy another's work to build on and extend. For example, a professor may create an OSF project of materials for individual student use. Each student forks the project to have his or her own copy of the materials to start his/her own work.\n\nWhen creating a fork, your fork will only contain public components of the current registration and components for which you are a contributor. Private components that you do not have access to will not be forked.\n#### Required\nThere are no required attributes when creating a fork, as all of the forked registration's attributes will be copied from the current registration.\n\nThe `title` field is optional, with the default title being \"Fork of \" prepended to the current registration's title.\n#### Returns\nReturns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the complete representation of the forked registration, if the request is successful.\nIf the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.

      "description": "All endpoints respond to the `fields` query parameter as described in the [JSON-API spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets). From the specification:\n\n> A client MAY request that an endpoint return only specific fields in the response on a per-type basis by including a fields[TYPE] parameter.\n> \n> The value of the fields parameter MUST be a comma-separated (U+002C COMMA, “,”) list that refers to the name(s) of the fields to be returned.\n> \n> If a client requests a restricted set of fields for a given resource type, an endpoint MUST NOT include additional fields in resource objects of that type in its response.\n\n#### Basic Usage When making a request to an endpoint that returns a serialized object of some `type`, you can specify `fields[]=` to receive a subset of the object's fields in the response. For example, the request below will serialize only the `title` attribute and `children` relationship for each node in the response. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?fields[nodes]=title,children Sparse fieldsets can be used to restrict both attribute and relationship fields. Note that top-level objects (such as `type`, `id`, `attributes`, `relationships`, and `links`) will always be serialized and cannot be excluded. #### Advanced Usage Sparse fieldsets can be used to restrict any entity returned in the response. For example, the request below will serialize only the `full_name` attribute for each user (auto-embedded by the `embed=contributors` query parameter), and the `title` attribute for each node. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?fields[nodes]=title,contributors&embed=contributors&fields[users]=full_name Any field specified in another query parameters used by the serializer (e.g. `embed`) must also be included in the sparse fieldset. For example, fields that are being embedded on the sparse type (e.g. `nodes`) must also be included in `fields[]` when using embeds, or the embed will be invalid. A request to embed contributors and restrict nodes to only return the `title` attribute should have the form: https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?embed=contributors&fields[nodes]=title,contributors **NOT** https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?embed=contributors&fields[nodes]=title",
