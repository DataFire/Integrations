For every term, you can also use ‘+’ and ‘-‘ modifier characters to indicate that a term is “mandatory” or “prohibited” (by default, terms are considered to be “mandatory”). For example, in a query such as query=term_a -term_b, sounds including term_b will not match the search criteria. The query does a weighted search over some sound properties including sound tags, the sound name, its description, pack name and the sound id. Therefore, searching for query=123 will find you sounds with id 1234, sounds that have 1234 in the description, in the tags, etc. You’ll find some examples below. Using an empty query (query= or query=\"\") will return all Freeosund sounds."
