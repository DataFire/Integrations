For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of <code>192.0.2.111</code>, create a resource record set with a <code>Type</code> of <code>A</code> and a <code>ContinentCode</code> of <code>AF</code>.</p> <note> <p>Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not supported.</p> </note> <p>If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.</p> <p>You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location.</p> <p>The value <code>*</code> in the <code>CountryCode</code> element matches all geographic locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the <code>Name</code> and <code>Type</code> elements.</p> <important> <p>Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Amazon Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of <code>CountryCode</code> is <code>*</code>, which handles both queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a <code>*</code> resource record set, Amazon Route 53 returns a \"no answer\" response for queries from those locations.</p> </important> <p>You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the <code>Name</code> and <code>Type</code> elements as geolocation resource record sets.</p>"

Configuring health checks only makes sense in the following configurations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You're checking the health of the resource record sets in a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets. If the health check for one resource record set specifies an endpoint that is not healthy, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using the value for that resource record set.</p> </li> <li> <p>You set <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> to true for the resource record sets in a group of alias, weighted alias, latency alias, geolocation alias, or failover alias resource record sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets that are referenced by the alias resource record sets.</p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>Amazon Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint specified in the resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the <code>Value</code> element. When you add a <code>HealthCheckId</code> element to a resource record set, Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check. </p> </important> <p>For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the United States, for North America, and for all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks the resource record sets for the United States, for North America, and for all locations (a resource record set for which the value of <code>CountryCode</code> is <code>*</code>), in that order, until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy. </p> <p>If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each <code>HTTP</code> server that is serving content for <code>www.example.com</code>. For the value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the server (such as <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>), not the name of the resource record sets (example.com).</p> <important> <p>n this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> matches the name of the resource record sets and then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.</p> </important> <p>For more information, see the following topics in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html\">Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html\">Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone</a> </p> </li> </ul>"
