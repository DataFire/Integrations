## Description

The Feed API provides the ability to download TSV_GZIP feed files containing eBay items and an hourly snapshot file of the items that have changed within an hour for a specific category, date and marketplace. In addition to the API, there is an open source Feed SDK written in Java that downloads, combines files into a single file when needed, and unzips the entire feed file. It also lets you specify field filters to curate the items in the file.

### getItemFeed
This method lets you download a TSV_GZIP (tab separated value gzip) Item feed file. The feed file contains all the items from all the child categories of the specified category. The first line of the file is the header, which labels the columns and indicates the order of the values on each line. Each header is described in the Response fields section. There are two types of item feed files generated: A daily Item feed file containing all the newly listed items for a specific category, date,n and marketplace (feed_scope = NEWLY_LISTED) A weekly Item Bootstrap feed file containing all the items in a specific category and marketplace (feed_scope = ALL_ACTIVE) Note: Filters are applied to the feed files. For details, see Feed File Filters. When curating the items returned, be sure to code as if these filters are not applied as they can be changed or removed in the future. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/feed/v1_beta/ Sandbox URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/feed/v1_beta/ Downloading feed files Item feed files are binary gzip files. If the file is larger than 100 MB, the download must be streamed in chunks. You specify the size of the chunks in bytes using the Range request header. The Content-range response header indicates where in the full resource this partial chunk of data belongs and the total number of bytes in the file. For more information about using these headers, see Retrieving a gzip feed file. In addition to the API, there is an open source Feed SDK written in Java that downloads, combines files into a single file when needed, and unzips the entire feed file. It also lets you specify field filters to curate the items in the file. Note: The response is always a TSV_GZIP file. However for documentation purposes, the response is shown as JSON fields so that the value returned in each column can be explained. The order of the response fields, shows you the order of the columns in the feed file. Restrictions For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.


```js
ebay_buy_feed.getItemFeed({
  "X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID": "",
  "Range": "",
  "feed_scope": "",
  "category_id": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID **required** `string`: The ID of the eBay marketplace where the item is hosted. Note: This value is case sensitive. For example: &nbsp;&nbsp;X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID = EBAY_US For a list of supported sites see, API Restrictions.
  * Range **required** `string`: This header specifies the range in bytes of the chunks of the gzip file being returned. Format: bytes=startpos-endpos For example, the following retrieves the first 10 MBs of the feed file. &nbsp;&nbsp;Range bytes=0-10485760 For more information about using this headers, see Retrieving a gzip feed file. Maximum: 100 MB (10MB in the Sandbox)
  * feed_scope **required** `string`: Specifies the type of feed file to return. Valid Values: NEWLY_LISTED - Returns the daily Item feed file containing all Good 'Til Cancelled items that were listed on the day specified by the date parameter in the category specified by the category_id parameter. /item?feed_scope=NEWLY_LISTED&amp;category_id=15032&amp;date=20170925 ALL_ACTIVE - Returns the weekly Item Bootstrap feed file containing all the Good 'Til Cancelled items in the category specified by the category_id parameter. Note: Bootstrap files are generated every Tuesday and the file is available on Wednesday. However, the exact time the file is available can vary so we recommend you download the Bootstrap file on Thursday. The items in the file are the items that were in the specified category on Sunday. /item?feed_scope=ALL_ACTIVE&amp;category_id=15032
  * category_id **required** `string`: An eBay top-level category ID of the items to be returned in the feed file. The list of eBay category IDs changes over time and category IDs are not the same across all the eBay marketplaces. To get a list of the top-level categories for a marketplaces, you can use the Taxonomy API getCategoryTree method. This method retrieves the complete category tree for the marketplace. The top-level categories are identified by the categoryTreeNodeLevel field. For example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;categoryTreeNodeLevel&quot;: 1 For details see Get Categories for Buy APIs. Restriction: Must be a top-level (L1) category
  * date `string`: The date of the daily Item feed file (feed_scope=NEWLY_LISTED) you want. The date is required only for the daily Item feed file. If you specify a date for the Item Bootstrap file (feed_scope=ALL_ACTIVE), the date is ignored and the latest file is returned. The date the Item Bootstrap feed file was generated is returned in the Last-Modified response header. The Item feed files are generated every day and there are 14 daily files available. Note: The daily Item feed files are available each day after 9AM MST (US Mountain Standard Time), which is -7 hours UTC time. There is a 48 hour latency when generating the Item feed files. This means you can download the file for July 10th on July 12 after 9AM MST. Note: For categories with a large number of items, the latency can be up to 72 hours. Format: yyyyMMdd Requirements: Required when feed_scope=NEWLY_LISTED Must be within 3-14 days in the past

#### Output
* output [ItemResponse](#itemresponse)

### getItemGroupFeed
This method lets you download a TSV_GZIP (tab separated value gzip) Item Group feed file. An item group is an item that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. There are two types of item group feed files generated: A daily Item Group feed file containing the item group variation information associated with items returned in the Item feed file for a specific day, category, and marketplace. (feed_scope = NEWLY_LISTED) A weekly Item Group Bootstrap feed file containing all the item group variation information associated with items returned in the Item Bootstrap feed file for all the items in a specific category. (feed_scope = ALL_ACTIVE) Note: Filters are applied to the feed files. For details, see Feed File Filters. When curating the items returned, be sure to code as if these filters are not applied as they can be changed or removed in the future. The contents of these feed files are based on the contents of the corresponding daily Item or Item Bootstrap feed file. When a new Item or Item Bootstrap feed file is generated, the service reads the file and if an item in the file has a primaryItemGroupId value, which indicates the item is part of an item group, it uses that value to return the item group (parent item) information for that item in the corresponding Item Group or Item Group Bootstrap feed file. This information includes the name/value pair of the aspects of the items in this group returned in the variesByLocalizedAspects column. For example, if the item was a shirt some of the variation names could be Size, Color, etc. Also the images for the various aspects are returned in the additionalImageUrls column. The first line in any feed file is the header, which labels the columns and indicates the order of the values on each line. Each header is described in the Response fields section. Combining the Item Group and Item feed files The Item Group or Item Group Bootstrap feed file contains details about the item group (parent item), including the item group ID itemGroupId. You match the value of itemGroupId from the Item Group feed file with the value of primaryItemGroupId from the corresponding daily Item or Item Bootstrap feed file. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/feed/v1_beta/ Sandbox URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/feed/v1_beta/ Downloading feed files Item Group feed files are binary gzip files. If the file is larger than 100 MB, the download must be streamed in chunks. You specify the size of the chunks in bytes using the Range request header. The content-range response header indicates where in the full resource this partial chunk of data belongs and the total number of bytes in the file. For more information about using these headers, see Retrieving a gzip feed file. Note: The response is always only a TSV_GZIP file. However for documentation purposes, the response is shown as JSON fields so that the value returned in each column can be explained. The order of the response fields, shows you the order of the columns in the feed file. Restrictions For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.

### getItemSnapshotFeed
The Hourly Snapshot feed file is generated each hour every day for most categories. This method lets you download an Hourly Snapshot TSV_GZIP (tab separated value gzip) feed file containing the details of all the items that have changed within the specified day and hour for a specific category. This means to generate the 8AM file of items that have changed from 8AM and 8:59AM, the service starts at 9AM. You can retrieve the 8AM snapshot file at 10AM. Note: Filters are applied to the feed files. For details, see Feed File Filters. When curating the items returned, be sure to code as if these filters are not applied as they can be changed or removed in the future. You can use the response from this method to update the item details of items stored in your database. By comparing the value of itemSnapshotDate for the same item you will be able to tell which information is the latest. Important: When the value of the availability column is UNAVAILABLE, only the itemId and availability columns are populated. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/feed/v1_beta/ Sandbox URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/feed/v1_beta/ Downloading feed files Hourly snapshot feed files are binary gzip files. If the file is larger than 100 MB, the download must be streamed in chunks. You specify the size of the chunks in bytes using the Range request header. The Content-range response header indicates where in the full resource this partial chunk of data belongs and the total number of bytes in the file. For more information about using these headers, see Retrieving a gzip feed file. Note: The response is always a TSV_GZIP file. However for documentation purposes, the response is shown as JSON fields so that the value returned in each column can be explained. The order of the response fields, shows you the order of the columns in the feed file. Restrictions For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.


```js
ebay_buy_feed.getItemSnapshotFeed({

}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID **required** `string`: The ID of the eBay marketplace where the item is hosted. Note: This value is case sensitive. For example: &nbsp;&nbsp;X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID = EBAY_US For a list of supported sites see, API Restrictions.
  * Range **required** `string`: This header specifies the range in bytes of the chunks of the gzip file being returned. Format: bytes=startpos-endpos For example, the following retrieves the first 10 MBs of the feed file. &nbsp;&nbsp;Range bytes=0-10485760 For more information about using this headers, see Retrieving a gzip feed file. Maximum: 100 MB (10MB in the Sandbox)
  * category_id **required** `string`: An eBay top-level category ID of the items to be returned in the feed file. The list of eBay category IDs changes over time and category IDs are not the same across all the eBay marketplaces. To get a list of the top-level categories for a marketplace, you can use the Taxonomy API getCategoryTree method. This method retrieves the complete category tree for the marketplace. The top-level categories are identified by the categoryTreeNodeLevel field. For example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;categoryTreeNodeLevel&quot;: 1 For details see Get Categories for Buy APIs. Restriction: Must be a top-level category
  * snapshot_date **required** `string`: The date and hour of the snapshot feed file you want. Each file contains the items that changed within the hour in the specified category. So, the 9AM file contains the items that changed between 9AM and 9:59AM on the day specified. It takes 2 hours to generate a snapshot file, which means to get the file for 9AM the earliest you could submit the call is at 11AM. There are 7 days of Hourly Snapshot feed files available. Note: The Feed API uses GMT, so you must convert your local time to GMT. For example, if you lived in California and wanted the September 15th 7pm file, you would submit the following call: item_snapshot?category_id=625&amp;snapshot_date=2017-09-16T02:00:00.000Z Format: UTC format (yyyy-MM-ddThh:00:00.000Z) Files are generated on the hour, so minutes and seconds are always zeros.

## Definitions

### Item
* Item `object`: The type that defines the columns returned in the <b>Item</b> feed file.
  * acceptedPaymentMethods `string`: Indicates the credit card service that will be used to process the transaction. If this column contains PAYPAL, you can use the Buy Order API to checkout and purchase the item. If this column is empty, you must use another method for checkout.
  * additionalImageUrls `string`: A pipe separated (|) list of URLs for the additional images of the item. These images are in addition to the primary image, which is returned in the imageUrl column. Note: This column can contain multiple values.
  * additionalShippingCostPerUnit `string`: Any per item additional shipping costs for a multi-item purchase. For example, let's say the shipping cost for a power cord is $3. But for an additional cord, the shipping cost is only $1. So if you bought 3 cords, the shippingCost would be $3 and this value would be $2 ($1 for each additional item).
  * alerts `string`: A pipe-separated list of alerts available for the item. For example, if the DELAYED_DELIVERY alert was returned for an item, it would indicate a delay in shipping by the seller.
  * availability `string`: An enumeration value representing the item's availability (possibility of being purchased). Values: AVAILABLE TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE UNAVAILABLE Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list. For implementation help, refer to <a href='https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/buy/feed/types/api:AvailabilityEnum'>eBay API documentation</a>
  * availabilityThreshold `integer`: This column has a value only when the seller sets their 'display item quantity' preference to Display &quot;More than 10 available&quot; in your listing (if applicable). The value of this column will be &quot;10&quot;, which is the threshold value. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this value.
  * availabilityThresholdType `string`: This column has a value only when the seller sets their Display Item Quantity preference to Display &quot;More than 10 available&quot; in your listing (if applicable). The value of this column will be MORE_THAN. This indicates that the seller has more than the 'Display Item Quantity', which is 10, in stock for this item. The following are the Display Item Quantity preferences the seller can set. Display &quot;More than 10 available&quot; in your listing (if applicable) If the seller enables this preference, this column will have a value as long as there are more than 10 of this item in inventory. If the quantity is equal to 10 or drops below 10, this column will be null and the estimated quantity of the item is returned in the estimatedAvailableQuantity column. Display the exact quantity in your items If the seller enables this preference, the availabilityThresholdType and availabilityThreshold columns will be null and the estimated quantity of the item is returned in the estimatedAvailableQuantity column. Note: Because the quantity of an item can change several times within a second, it is impossible to return the exact quantity. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to these preferences. For implementation help, refer to <a href='https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/buy/feed/types/api:AvailabilityThresholdEnum'>eBay API documentation</a>

For all other marketplaces besides the US and Australia, Condition ID 2000 still maps to 'Manufacturer Refurbished'. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list.
  * conditionId `string`: The identifier of the condition of the item. For example, 1000 is the identifier for NEW. For a list of condition names and IDs, see Item Condition IDs and Names. Note: In the US and Australian marketplaces, Condition ID 2000 now maps to an item condition of 'Certified Refurbished', but this item condition is only available for use for a select number of US and Australian sellers. For all other marketplaces besides the US and Australia, Condition ID 2000 still maps to 'Manufacturer Refurbished'. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list.
  * deliveryOptions `string`: A comma-separated list of available delivery options. This column lets you filter out items than cannot be shipped to the buyer. Valid Values: SHIP_TO_HOME, SELLER_ARRANGED_LOCAL_PICKUP, IN_STORE_PICKUP, and PICKUP_DROP_OFF. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list.
