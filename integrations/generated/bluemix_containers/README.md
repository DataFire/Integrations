## Description

Containers are virtual software objects that include all the elements that an app needs to run. A container has the benefits of resource isolation and allocation but is more portable and efficient than, for example, a virtual machine.

 This documentation describes the IBM Containers API, which is based on the Docker Remote API. The API provides endpoints that you can use to create and manage your single containers and container groups in Bluemix. Endpoints are summarized under the following tags:

- **Authentication**: Retrieve and refresh your TLS certificates.
- **Private Docker images registry**: Create your own private Docker images registry in Bluemix by setting a namespace for your organization.
- **Images**: View, build, and push your images to your private Bluemix registry so you can use them with IBM Containers. You can also scan your container images with the Vulnerability Advisor against standard policies set by the organization manager and a database of known Ubuntu issues.
- **Single Containers**: Create and manage single containers in Bluemix. Use a single container to implement short-lived processes or to run simple tests as you develop an app or service. To make your single container available from the internet, review the `Public IP addresses` endpoints.
- **Container Groups**: Create and manage your container groups in Bluemix. A container group consists of multiple single containers that are all created from the same container image and as a consequence are configured in the same way. Container groups offer further options at no cost to make your app highly available. These options include in-built load balancing, auto-recovery of unhealthy container instances, and auto-scaling of container instances based on CPU and memory usage. Map a public route to your container group to make your app accessible from the internet.
- **Public IP addresses**: Use these endpoints to request public IP addresses for your space. You can bind this IP address to your container to make your container accessible from the internet.
- **File shares**: Create, list and delete file shares in a space. A file share is a NFS storage system that hosts Docker volumes.
- **Volumes**: Create and manage container volumes in your space to persist the data of your containers.


 Each API request requires an HTTP header that includes the 'X-Auth-Token’ and 'X-Auth-Project-Id’ parameter.

- **X-Auth-Token**: The JSON web token (JWT) that you receive when logging into the Bluemix platform. It allows you to use the IBM Containers REST API, access services, and resources. Run `cf oauth-token` to retrieve your access token information.
- **X-Auth-Project-Id**: The unique ID of your organization space where you want to create or work with your containers. Run `cf space <space_name> --guid`, where `<space_name>` is the name of your space, to retrieve your space ID.


 For further information about how containers work in the IBM Containers service, review the documentation under https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html.

## Actions

### build.post
This API builds a new container image from a Dockerfile that is stored on your local machine and pushes the image to the private Bluemix registry (corresponding IBM Containers command: `cf ic build`).

 To push an image to your Bluemix registry, a namespace must be set for the organization. Run `cf ic namespace get` or call the `GET /registry/namespaces` API to check if a namespace is already set. If not, run `cf ic namespace set NAMESPACE` or call the `PUT /registry/namespaces/{namespace}` API to set a namespace for your organization.


```js
bluemix_containers.build.post({
  "X-Auth-Token": "",
  "X-Auth-Project-Id": "",
  "t": "",
  "file": null
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * X-Auth-Token **required** `string`: The Bluemix JSON web token that you receive when logging into Bluemix. Run `cf oauth-token` to retrieve your access token.
  * X-Auth-Project-Id **required** `string`: The unique ID of your organization space where you want to create or work with your containers. Run `cf space <space_name> --guid`, where `<space_name>` is the name of your space, to retrieve your space ID.
  * t **required** `string`: Tag the image with the full path to your private Bluemix registry in the following format: `t=registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/<image_name>:<tag>`. This path is used to push the image to the private Bluemix registry after it is built.
  * q `boolean`: You can choose whether or not to show the verbose build output to review every step during the container image build. If you set the query parameter to `q=false`, `q=False`, or `q=0`, the verbose build output is suppressed. To show the verbose build output, enter `q=true`, `q=True`, or `q=1`.
  * nocache `boolean`: If you set the query parameter to `nocache=true`, `nocache=True`, or `nocache=1`, the cache will not be used to build your image. To use the cache, enter `nocache=false`, `nocache=False`, or `nocache=0`.
  * pull `boolean`: If set to pull=true, pull=True, or pull=1, then a newer version of the image is always attempted to be pulled even though an older version of the image exists locally. If set to pull=false, pull=False, or pull=0, then the local image will be used if one exists.

#### Output
*Output schema unknown*

### containers.create.post
This endpoint creates and starts a single container in your space based on the Docker image that is specified in the Image field of the request json. A single container in IBM Containers is similar to a container that you create in your local Docker environment. Single containers are a good way to start with IBM Containers and to learn about how containers work in the IBM Cloud and the features that IBM Containers provides. They are also recommended when you want to run simple app tests or during the development process of an app.

 In the Docker API there are two separate APIs to create and start a container. However in IBM Containers a container is created and started in a single API call. Therefore, this API merges parameters from the Docker API to create and start container.

 To create a container with IBM Containers, you must at least define the image that the container is based on.

- Image: You must include the full path to the image in your private Bluemix registry in the format: `registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/<image>`.


```js
bluemix_containers.containers.create.post({
  "X-Auth-Token": "",
  "X-Auth-Project-Id": "",
  "Param": null
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * X-Auth-Token **required** `string`: The Bluemix JSON web token that you receive when logging into Bluemix. Run `cf oauth-token` to retrieve your access token.
  * X-Auth-Project-Id **required** `string`: The unique ID of your organization space where you want to create or work with your containers. Run `cf space <space_name> --guid`, where `<space_name>` is the name of your space, to retrieve your space ID.
  * Param **required** [CreateContainer](#createcontainer)
  * name `string`: Choose a name for your container. The characters in the name can include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, periods (.), underscores (_), or hyphens (-), but the name must start with a letter.

#### Output
* output [ContainerId](#containerid)

### containers.floating_ips.get
This endpoint returns a list of all public IP addresses that are allocated to a space and not bound to a container. If you want to list all public IP addresses that are allocated to a space, even those that are already bound to a container, use the `all` query parameter (corrsponding IBM Containers command: `cf ic ip list`).


```js
bluemix_containers.containers.floating_ips.get({
  "X-Auth-Token": "",
  "X-Auth-Project-Id": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * X-Auth-Token **required** `string`: The Bluemix JSON web token that you receive when logging into Bluemix. Run `cf oauth-token` to retrieve your access token.
  * X-Auth-Project-Id **required** `string`: The unique ID of your organization space where you want to create or work with your containers. Run `cf space <space_name> --guid`, where `<space_name>` is the name of your space, to retrieve your space ID.
  * all `boolean`: If this option is set to `all=1`, `all=True`, or `all=true`, all public IP addresses that are allocated to a space are returned. If this option is set to `all=0`, `all=False`, or `all=false`, only available public IP addresses that are allocated but not bound to a container are returned. By default, only available public IP addresses are returned.

#### Output
* output `array`
  * items [FloatingIP](#floatingip)

### containers.floating_ips.request.post
This endpoint requests a new public IP address for a space (corresponding IBM Containers command: `cf ic ip request`). The number of public IP addresses depends on the quota that is assigned to the space. If there is not enough quota left to request a new public IP address, you can either contact your organization manager to increase the quota, or unbind an existing IP address from a container by running `cf ic ip unbind <ip_adress> <container>` command, or  calling the `POST /container/{name_or_id}/floating-ips/{ip}/unbind` endpoint.


```js
bluemix_containers.containers.floating_ips.request.post({
  "X-Auth-Token": "",
  "X-Auth-Project-Id": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * X-Auth-Token **required** `string`: The Bluemix JSON web token that you receive when logging into Bluemix. Run `cf oauth-token` to retrieve your access token.

### containers.floating_ips.ip.release.post
This endpoint releases a public IP address from a space (corresponding IBM Containers command: `cf ic ip release <ip_adress>`). The public IP address is no longer allocated to the space. If a container was bound to the IP address, it is automatically unbound.


```js
bluemix_containers.containers.floating_ips.ip.release.post({
  "X-Auth-Token": "",
  "X-Auth-Project-Id": "",
  "ip": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input

  * ip **required** `string`: The public IP address that you want to release. Run `cf ic ip list` or call the `GET /containers/floating-ips?all=true` endpoint to review all public IP address that are allocated to your space. After a public IP address is released, it will no longer be allocated to your space.

#### Output
*Output schema unknown*

### volumes.create.post
This endpoints creates a new volume in your space (corresponding IBM Containers command: `cf ic volume create VOLNAME`). A volume is used to persist and access app data between container restarts. Volumes are hosted on file shares that define the available actual storage in Bluemix and the number of input and output transactions per second (IOPS).

 After you have created a volume, you must mount it to a container by using the `--volume` option in the `cf ic run` (single containers) or `cf ic group create` (container groups) command. You can also define the volume as part of the HTTP body and send a request to the `POST /containers/create` (single containers) or `POST /containers/groups` (container groups) endpoints.

 Note: If you mount multiple containers in a space to the same volume, they share the data in the volume and can access them anytime. When a container is deleted, the associated volume is not removed.

### volumes.fs.create.post
This endpoint creates a new file share in a space (corresponding IBM Containers command: `cf ic volume fs-create FSNAME FSSIZE FSIOPS`).

 A file share is a persistent NFS-based (Network File System) storage system that hosts Docker volumes in a Bluemix space and allows a user to store and access container and app-related files. To store files in a file share, you must create a container volume and save the data into this volume.

 As soon as you create your first volume in a space with the `cf ic volume create VOLNAME` command or the `POST /volumes/create` API endpoint, a default file share with 20 GB at 4 IOPS (Input Output operations Per Second) is created at no cost.

The organization manager can create file shares with specific storage size and IOPS to meet the storage needs of the space. File shares can be provisioned in sizes from 20 GB to 12 TB and at IOPS per GB of 0.25, 2 or 4. Run `cf ic volume fs-flavor-list` or call the `GET /volumes/fs/flavors/json` API endpoint to retrieve a list of available file share sizes. The file share size in relation to the number of IOPS impacts the speed that data can be read and written from and to the container volume.


```js
