### publications.publicationId.posts.post
creating a post and associating it with a publication on Medium. The request also shows this association, considering posts a collection of resources under a publication

There are additional rules around publishing that each request to this API must respect:
  - If the authenticated user is an 'editor' for the publication, they can create posts with any publish status. Posts published as 'public' or 'unlisted' will appear in collection immediately, while posts created as 'draft' will remain in pending state under publication.
  - If the authenticated user is a 'writer' for the chosen publication, they can only create a post as a 'draft'. That post will remain in pending state under publication until an editor for the publication approves it.
  - If the authenticated user is neither a 'writer' nor an 'editor', they are not allowed to create any posts in a publication.



```js
medium.publications.publicationId.posts.post({
  "publicationId": "",
  "body": {
    "title": "",
    "contentFormat": "",
    "content": ""
  }
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * publicationId **required** `string`: Here publicationId is the id of the publication the post is being created under. The publicationId can be acquired from the API for listing user’s publications.
  * body **required** [Post](#post)

#### Output
* output [PostDetails](#postdetails)

### users.authorId.posts.post
Creates a post on the authenticated user’s profile.


```js
medium.users.authorId.posts.post({
  "authorId": "",
  "body": {
    "title": "",
    "contentFormat": "",
    "content": ""
  }
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * authorId **required** `string`: authorId is the user id of the authenticated user.
  * body **required** [Post](#post)

#### Output
* output [PostDetails](#postdetails)

### users.userId.publications.get

```js
medium.users.userId.publications.get({
  "userId": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * userId **required** `string`: A unique identifier for the user.

  * contentFormat **required** `string`: The format of the "content" field. There are two valid values, "html", and "markdown"
  * license `string` (values: all-rights-reserved, cc-40-by, cc-40-by-sa, cc-40-by-nd, cc-40-by-nc, cc-40-by-nc-nd, cc-40-by-nc-sa, cc-40-zero, public-domain): The license of the post.
