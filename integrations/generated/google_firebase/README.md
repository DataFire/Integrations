## Description

The Firebase Management API enables programmatic setup and management of Firebase projects, including a project's Firebase resources and Firebase apps.

## Actions

### oauthCallback
Exchange the code passed to your redirect URI for an access_token


```js
google_firebase.oauthCallback({
  "code": ""
}, context)
```

* input `object`
  * code **required** `string`

#### Output
* output `object`
  * access_token `string`
  * refresh_token `string`
  * token_type `string`
  * scope `string`
  * expiration `string`

### oauthRefresh
Exchange a refresh_token for an access_token


```js
google_firebase.oauthRefresh(null, context)
```

#### Input

#### Output
* output `object`
  * access_token `string`
  * refresh_token `string`
  * token_type `string`

### firebase.availableProjects.list
Lists each [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) `Project`] (https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects) that can have Firebase resources added to it. A Project will only be listed if: - The caller has sufficient [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) permissions to call AddFirebase. - The Project is not already a FirebaseProject. - The Project is not in an Organization which has policies that prevent Firebase resources from being added. 


```js
google_firebase.firebase.availableProjects.list({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * pageSize `integer`: The maximum number of Projects to return in the response. The server may return fewer than this value at its discretion. If no value is specified (or too large a value is specified), the server will impose its own limit. This value cannot be negative.
  * pageToken `string`: Token returned from a previous call to `ListAvailableProjects` indicating where in the set of Projects to resume listing.
  * $.xgafv `string` (values: 1, 2): V1 error format.
  * access_token `string`: OAuth access token.
  * alt `string` (values: json, media, proto): Data format for response.
  * callback `string`: JSONP
  * fields `string`: Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
  * key `string`: API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
  * oauth_token `string`: OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
  * prettyPrint `boolean`: Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
  * quotaUser `string`: Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.
  * upload_protocol `string`: Upload protocol for media (e.g. "raw", "multipart").

#### Output
* output [ListAvailableProjectsResponse](#listavailableprojectsresponse)

### firebase.projects.list
Lists each FirebaseProject accessible to the caller. The elements are returned in no particular order, but they will be a consistent view of the Projects when additional requests are made with a `pageToken`. This method is eventually consistent with Project mutations, which means newly provisioned Projects and recent modifications to existing Projects might not be reflected in the set of Projects. The list will include only ACTIVE Projects. Use GetFirebaseProject for consistent reads as well as for additional Project details.

### firebase.projects.availableLocations.list
Lists the valid Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resource locations for the specified Project (including a FirebaseProject). One of these locations can be selected as the Project's [_default_ GCP resource location](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations), which is the geographical location where the Project's resources, such as Cloud Firestore, will be provisioned by default. However, if the default GCP resource location has already been set for the Project, then this setting cannot be changed. This call checks for any possible [location restrictions](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/defining-locations) for the specified Project and, thus, might return a subset of all possible GCP resource locations. To list all GCP resource locations (regardless of any restrictions), call the endpoint without specifying a unique project identifier (that is, `/v1beta1/{parent=projects/-}/listAvailableLocations`). To call `ListAvailableLocations` with a specified project, a member must be at minimum a Viewer of the Project. Calls without a specified project do not require any specific project permissions.


```js
google_firebase.firebase.projects.availableLocations.list({
  "parent": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * parent **required** `string`: The FirebaseProject for which to list GCP resource locations, in the format: projects/PROJECT_IDENTIFIER Refer to the `FirebaseProject` [`name`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.name) field for details about PROJECT_IDENTIFIER values. If no unique project identifier is specified (that is, `projects/-`), the returned list does not take into account org-specific or project-specific location restrictions.
  * pageSize `integer`: The maximum number of locations to return in the response. The server may return fewer than this value at its discretion. If no value is specified (or too large a value is specified), then the server will impose its own limit. This value cannot be negative.
  * pageToken `string`: Token returned from a previous call to `ListAvailableLocations` indicating where in the list of locations to resume listing.
  * $.xgafv `string` (values: 1, 2): V1 error format.
  * access_token `string`: OAuth access token.
  * alt `string` (values: json, media, proto): Data format for response.
  * callback `string`: JSONP
  * fields `string`: Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
  * key `string`: API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
  * oauth_token `string`: OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
  * prettyPrint `boolean`: Returns response with indentations and line breaks.

#### Output
* output [ListAvailableLocationsResponse](#listavailablelocationsresponse)

### firebase.projects.defaultLocation.finalize
Sets the default Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resource location for the specified FirebaseProject. This method creates an App Engine application with a [default Cloud Storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/googlecloudstorageclient/setting-up-cloud-storage#activating_a_cloud_storage_bucket), located in the specified [`locationId`](#body.request_body.FIELDS.location_id). This location must be one of the available [GCP resource locations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations). After the default GCP resource location is finalized, or if it was already set, it cannot be changed. The default GCP resource location for the specified `FirebaseProject` might already be set because either the underlying GCP `Project` already has an App Engine application or `FinalizeDefaultLocation` was previously called with a specified `locationId`. Any new calls to `FinalizeDefaultLocation` with a *different* specified `locationId` will return a 409 error. The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations), which can be used to track the provisioning process. The [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) type of the `Operation` is google.protobuf.Empty. The `Operation` can be polled by its `name` using GetOperation until `done` is true. When `done` is true, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` has succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) will be set to a google.protobuf.Empty; if the `Operation` has failed, its `error` will be set to a google.rpc.Status. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation. All fields listed in the [request body](#request-body) are required. To call `FinalizeDefaultLocation`, a member must be an Owner of the Project.

### firebase.projects.addGoogleAnalytics
Links the specified FirebaseProject with an existing [Google Analytics account](http://www.google.com/analytics/). Using this call, you can either: - Specify an `analyticsAccountId` to provision a new Google Analytics property within the specified account and associate the new property with the `FirebaseProject`. - Specify an existing `analyticsPropertyId` to associate the property with the `FirebaseProject`. Note that when you call `AddGoogleAnalytics`: 1. The first check determines if any existing data streams in the Google Analytics property correspond to any existing Firebase Apps in the `FirebaseProject` (based on the `packageName` or `bundleId` associated with the data stream). Then, as applicable, the data streams and apps are linked. Note that this auto-linking only applies to `AndroidApps` and `IosApps`. 2. If no corresponding data streams are found for the Firebase Apps, new data streams are provisioned in the Google Analytics property for each of the Firebase Apps. Note that a new data stream is always provisioned for a Web App even if it was previously associated with a data stream in the Analytics property. Learn more about the hierarchy and structure of Google Analytics accounts in the [Analytics documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9303323). The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to an AnalyticsDetails; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. To call `AddGoogleAnalytics`, a project member must be an Owner for the existing `FirebaseProject` and have the [`Edit` permission](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495) for the Google Analytics account. If the `FirebaseProject` already has Google Analytics enabled, and you call `AddGoogleAnalytics` using an `analyticsPropertyId` that's different from the currently associated property, then the call will fail. Analytics may have already been enabled in the Firebase console or by specifying `timeZone` and `regionCode` in the call to [`AddFirebase`](../../v1beta1/projects/addFirebase).

### firebase.projects.removeAnalytics
Unlinks the specified FirebaseProject from its Google Analytics account. This call removes the association of the specified `FirebaseProject` with its current Google Analytics property. However, this call does not delete the Google Analytics resources, such as the Google Analytics property or any data streams. These resources may be re-associated later to the `FirebaseProject` by calling [`AddGoogleAnalytics`](../../v1beta1/projects/addGoogleAnalytics) and specifying the same `analyticsPropertyId`. For Android Apps and iOS Apps, this call re-links data streams with their corresponding apps. However, for Web Apps, this call provisions a *new* data stream for each Web App. To call `RemoveAnalytics`, a project member must be an Owner for the `FirebaseProject`.


```js
google_firebase.firebase.projects.removeAnalytics({
  "parent": ""

  "parent": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input

### firebase.projects.addFirebase
Adds Firebase resources to the specified existing [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) `Project`] (https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects). Since a FirebaseProject is actually also a GCP `Project`, a `FirebaseProject` has the same underlying GCP identifiers (`projectNumber` and `projectId`). This allows for easy interop with Google APIs. The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to a FirebaseProject; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation. This method does not modify any billing account information on the underlying GCP `Project`. To call `AddFirebase`, a project member or service account must have the following permissions (the IAM roles of Editor and Owner contain these permissions): `firebase.projects.update`, `resourcemanager.projects.get`, `serviceusage.services.enable`, and `serviceusage.services.get`.


```js
google_firebase.firebase.projects.addFirebase({
  "project": ""
}, context)
```

* Status `object`: The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

    * items `object`
  * message `string`: A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.

### StatusProto
* StatusProto `object`: Wire-format for a Status object
  * canonicalCode `integer`: The canonical error code (see codes.proto) that most closely corresponds to this status. May be missing.
  * code `integer`: Numeric code drawn from the space specified below. Often, this is the canonical error space, and code is drawn from google3/util/task/codes.proto
  * message `string`: Detail message
  * messageSet [MessageSet](#messageset)
  * space `string`: The following are usually only present when code != 0 Space to which this status belongs

### StreamMapping
* StreamMapping `object`: A mapping of a Firebase App to a Google Analytics data stream
  * app `string`: The resource name of the Firebase App associated with the Google Analytics data stream, in the format: projects/PROJECT_IDENTIFIER/androidApps/APP_ID or projects/PROJECT_IDENTIFIER/iosApps/APP_ID or projects/PROJECT_IDENTIFIER /webApps/APP_ID Refer to the `FirebaseProject` [`name`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.name) field for details about PROJECT_IDENTIFIER values.
  * measurementId `string`: Applicable for Firebase Web Apps only. The unique Google-assigned identifier of the Google Analytics web stream associated with the Firebase Web App. Firebase SDKs use this ID to interact with Google Analytics APIs. Learn more about this ID and Google Analytics web streams in the [Analytics documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/9303475).
  * streamId `string`: The unique Google-assigned identifier of the Google Analytics data stream associated with the Firebase App. Learn more about Google Analytics data streams in the [Analytics documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9303323).

### WebApp
* WebApp `object`: Details of a Firebase App for the web.
  * appId `string`: Immutable. The globally unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the `WebApp`. This identifier should be treated as an opaque token, as the data format is not specified.
  * appUrls `array`: The URLs where the `WebApp` is hosted.
    * items `string`
  * displayName `string`: The user-assigned display name for the `WebApp`.
  * name `string`: The resource name of the WebApp, in the format: projects/PROJECT_IDENTIFIER /webApps/APP_ID * PROJECT_IDENTIFIER: the parent Project's [`ProjectNumber`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.project_number) ***(recommended)*** or its [`ProjectId`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.project_id). Learn more about using project identifiers in Google's [AIP 2510 standard](https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510). Note that the value for PROJECT_IDENTIFIER in any response body will be the `ProjectId`. * APP_ID: the globally unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the App (see [`appId`](../projects.webApps#WebApp.FIELDS.app_id)).
  * projectId `string`: Immutable. A user-assigned unique identifier of the parent FirebaseProject for the `WebApp`.
  * webId `string`: Output only. Immutable. A unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the `WebApp`. This identifier is only used to populate the `namespace` value for the `WebApp`. For most use cases, use `appId` to identify or reference the App. The `webId` value is only unique within a `FirebaseProject` and its associated Apps.

### WebAppConfig
* WebAppConfig `object`: Configuration metadata of a single Firebase App for the web.
  * apiKey `string`: The API key associated with the `WebApp`.
  * appId `string`: Immutable. The globally unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the `WebApp`.
  * authDomain `string`: The domain Firebase Auth configures for OAuth redirects, in the format: PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com
  * databaseURL `string`: The default Firebase Realtime Database URL.
  * locationId `string`: The ID of the Project's default GCP resource location. The location is one of the available [GCP resource locations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations). This field is omitted if the default GCP resource location has not been finalized yet. To set a Project's default GCP resource location, call [`FinalizeDefaultLocation`](../projects.defaultLocation/finalize) after you add Firebase resources to the Project.
  * measurementId `string`: The unique Google-assigned identifier of the Google Analytics web stream associated with the `WebApp`. Firebase SDKs use this ID to interact with Google Analytics APIs. This field is only present if the `WebApp` is linked to a web stream in a Google Analytics App + Web property. Learn more about this ID and Google Analytics web streams in the [Analytics documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/9303475). To generate a `measurementId` and link the `WebApp` with a Google Analytics web stream, call [`AddGoogleAnalytics`](../../v1beta1/projects/addGoogleAnalytics). For apps using the Firebase JavaScript SDK v7.20.0 and later, Firebase dynamically fetches the `measurementId` when your app initializes Analytics. Having this ID in your config object is optional, but it does serve as a fallback in the rare case that the dynamic fetch fails.
  * messagingSenderId `string`: The sender ID for use with Firebase Cloud Messaging.
  * projectId `string`: Immutable. A user-assigned unique identifier for the `FirebaseProject`.
  * storageBucket `string`: The default Cloud Storage for Firebase storage bucket name.
