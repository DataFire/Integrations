### metricDescriptors.list
List metric descriptors that match the query. If the query is not set, then all of the metric descriptors will be returned. Large responses will be paginated, use the nextPageToken returned in the response to request subsequent pages of results by setting the pageToken query parameter to the value of the nextPageToken.


```js
google_cloudmonitoring.metricDescriptors.list({
  "project": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * project **required** `string`: The project id. The value can be the numeric project ID or string-based project name.
  * count `integer`: Maximum number of metric descriptors per page. Used for pagination. If not specified, count = 100.
  * pageToken `string`: The pagination token, which is used to page through large result sets. Set this value to the value of the nextPageToken to retrieve the next page of results.
  * query `string`: The query used to search against existing metrics. Separate keywords with a space; the service joins all keywords with AND, meaning that all keywords must match for a metric to be returned. If this field is omitted, all metrics are returned.

It is not allowed to write a time series point that is older than the existing youngest point of that time series. Points that are older than the existing youngest point of that time series will be discarded silently. Therefore, users should make sure that points of a time series are written sequentially in the order of their end time.
