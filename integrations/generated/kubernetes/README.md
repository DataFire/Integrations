## Description



## Actions

### getCoreAPIVersions
get available API versions


```js
kubernetes.getCoreAPIVersions(null, context)
```

#### Input
*This action has no parameters*

#### Output
* output [io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.APIVersions](#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.apiversions)

### getCoreV1APIResources
get available resources


```js
kubernetes.getCoreV1APIResources(null, context)
```

#### Input
*This action has no parameters*

#### Output
* output [io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.APIResourceList](#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.apiresourcelist)

### listCoreV1ComponentStatus
list objects of kind ComponentStatus


```js
kubernetes.listCoreV1ComponentStatus({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Output
* output [io.k8s.api.core.v1.ComponentStatusList](#io.k8s.api.core.v1.componentstatuslist)

### readCoreV1ComponentStatus

  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field.

  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history.

### listCoreV1NamespacedEndpoints
list or watch objects of kind Endpoints


```js
kubernetes.listCoreV1NamespacedEndpoints({
  "namespace": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

### listCoreV1NamespacedPersistentVolumeClaim
list or watch objects of kind PersistentVolumeClaim


```js
kubernetes.listCoreV1NamespacedPersistentVolumeClaim({
  "namespace": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

  * orphanDependents `boolean`: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

### deleteCoreV1CollectionNode
delete collection of Node


```js

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

#### Output

If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
  * propagationPolicy `string`: Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

### listCoreV1PodForAllNamespaces
list or watch objects of kind Pod


```js
kubernetes.listCoreV1PodForAllNamespaces({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Output

### watchCoreV1LimitRangeListForAllNamespaces
watch individual changes to a list of LimitRange


```js
kubernetes.watchCoreV1LimitRangeListForAllNamespaces({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.

  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * name **required** `string`: name of the PersistentVolumeClaim
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Output

  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results.

  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

### deleteApiextensionsV1beta1CollectionCustomResourceDefinition
delete collection of CustomResourceDefinition


```js
kubernetes.deleteApiextensionsV1beta1CollectionCustomResourceDefinition({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

### watchApiregistrationV1APIServiceList
watch individual changes to a list of APIService


```js
kubernetes.watchApiregistrationV1APIServiceList({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Output
* output [io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.WatchEvent](#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.watchevent)

### listAppsV1DeploymentForAllNamespaces
list or watch objects of kind Deployment


```js

```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history.

```js
kubernetes.listAppsV1ReplicaSetForAllNamespaces({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

### watchAppsV1NamespacedDaemonSet
watch changes to an object of kind DaemonSet


```js
kubernetes.watchAppsV1NamespacedDaemonSet({
  "name": "",
  "namespace": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * name **required** `string`: name of the DaemonSet
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results.

  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects

If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available.

  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.

### watchAppsV1beta2NamespacedStatefulSet
watch changes to an object of kind StatefulSet


```js
kubernetes.watchAppsV1beta2NamespacedStatefulSet({
  "name": "",
  "namespace": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * name **required** `string`: name of the StatefulSet
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

### listBatchV1beta1CronJobForAllNamespaces
list or watch objects of kind CronJob


```js
kubernetes.listBatchV1beta1CronJobForAllNamespaces({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

### watchCertificatesV1beta1CertificateSigningRequestList
watch individual changes to a list of CertificateSigningRequest


```js
kubernetes.watchCertificatesV1beta1CertificateSigningRequestList({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

```js
kubernetes.listExtensionsV1beta1DeploymentForAllNamespaces({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Output
* output [io.k8s.api.extensions.v1beta1.DeploymentList](#io.k8s.api.extensions.v1beta1.deploymentlist)

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * name **required** `string`: name of the ReplicaSet
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * name **required** `string`: name of the NetworkPolicy
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

  * body **required** [io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.DeleteOptions](#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.deleteoptions)
  * gracePeriodSeconds `integer`: The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
  * orphanDependents `boolean`: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
  * propagationPolicy `string`: Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
  * name **required** `string`: name of the ClusterRole

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

### listRbacAuthorizationV1alpha1RoleBindingForAllNamespaces
list or watch objects of kind RoleBinding


```js
kubernetes.listRbacAuthorizationV1alpha1RoleBindingForAllNamespaces({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * name **required** `string`: name of the Role
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * name **required** `string`: name of the ClusterRole
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is ExternalName. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
  * externalIPs `array`: externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes.  The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP.  A common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes system.
    * items `string`
  * externalName `string`: externalName is the external reference that kubedns or equivalent will return as a CNAME record for this service. No proxying will be involved. Must be a valid RFC-1123 hostname (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires Type to be ExternalName.
  * externalTrafficPolicy `string`: externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service desires to route external traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints. "Local" preserves the client source IP and avoids a second hop for LoadBalancer and Nodeport type services, but risks potentially imbalanced traffic spreading. "Cluster" obscures the client source IP and may cause a second hop to another node, but should have good overall load-spreading.
  * healthCheckNodePort `integer`: healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service. If not specified, HealthCheckNodePort is created by the service api backend with the allocated nodePort. Will use user-specified nodePort value if specified by the client. Only effects when Type is set to LoadBalancer and ExternalTrafficPolicy is set to Local.
  * loadBalancerIP `string`: Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer LoadBalancer will get created with the IP specified in this field. This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.
  * loadBalancerSourceRanges `array`: If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature." More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-cloud-provider-firewall/
    * items `string`
  * ports `array`: The list of ports that are exposed by this service. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
    * items [io.k8s.api.core.v1.ServicePort](#io.k8s.api.core.v1.serviceport)
  * publishNotReadyAddresses `boolean`: publishNotReadyAddresses, when set to true, indicates that DNS implementations must publish the notReadyAddresses of subsets for the Endpoints associated with the Service. The default value is false. The primary use case for setting this field is to use a StatefulSet's Headless Service to propagate SRV records for its Pods without respect to their readiness for purpose of peer discovery.
  * selector `object`: Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching this selector. If empty or not present, the service is assumed to have an external process managing its endpoints, which Kubernetes will not modify. Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is ExternalName. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/
  * sessionAffinity `string`: Supports "ClientIP" and "None". Used to maintain session affinity. Enable client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to None. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
  * sessionAffinityConfig [io.k8s.api.core.v1.SessionAffinityConfig](#io.k8s.api.core.v1.sessionaffinityconfig)
  * type `string`: type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. "ExternalName" maps to the specified externalName. "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a stable IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the clusterIP.

  * groupPriorityMinimum **required** `integer`: GroupPriorityMininum is the priority this group should have at least. Higher priority means that the group is preferred by clients over lower priority ones. Note that other versions of this group might specify even higher GroupPriorityMininum values such that the whole group gets a higher priority. The primary sort is based on GroupPriorityMinimum, ordered highest number to lowest (20 before 10). The secondary sort is based on the alphabetical comparison of the name of the object.  (v1.bar before v1.foo) We'd recommend something like: *.k8s.io (except extensions) at 18000 and PaaSes (OpenShift, Deis) are recommended to be in the 2000s
  * insecureSkipTLSVerify `boolean`: InsecureSkipTLSVerify disables TLS certificate verification when communicating with this server. This is strongly discouraged.  You should use the CABundle instead.

  * version `string`: Version is the API version this server hosts.  For example, "v1"
  * versionPriority **required** `integer`: VersionPriority controls the ordering of this API version inside of its group.  Must be greater than zero. The primary sort is based on VersionPriority, ordered highest to lowest (20 before 10). Since it's inside of a group, the number can be small, probably in the 10s. In case of equal version priorities, the version string will be used to compute the order inside a group. If the version string is "kube-like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version strings, which are ordered lexicographically. "Kube-like" versions start with a "v", then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string "alpha" or "beta" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of versions: v10, v2, v1, v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1, foo10.
