## Description



## Actions

### getCoreAPIVersions
get available API versions


```js
kubernetes.getCoreAPIVersions(null, context)
```

#### Input
*This action has no parameters*

#### Output
* output [io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.APIVersions](#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.apiversions)

### getCoreV1APIResources
get available resources


```js
kubernetes.getCoreV1APIResources(null, context)
```

#### Input
*This action has no parameters*

#### Output
* output [io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.APIResourceList](#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.apiresourcelist)

### listCoreV1ComponentStatus
list objects of kind ComponentStatus


```js
kubernetes.listCoreV1ComponentStatus({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Output
* output [io.k8s.api.core.v1.ComponentStatusList](#io.k8s.api.core.v1.componentstatuslist)

### readCoreV1ComponentStatus

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

### listCoreV1NamespacedEndpoints
list or watch objects of kind Endpoints


```js
kubernetes.listCoreV1NamespacedEndpoints({
  "namespace": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects

When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

### listCoreV1NamespacedPersistentVolumeClaim
list or watch objects of kind PersistentVolumeClaim


```js
kubernetes.listCoreV1NamespacedPersistentVolumeClaim({
  "namespace": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
  * propagationPolicy `string`: Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.

### listCoreV1PodForAllNamespaces
list or watch objects of kind Pod


```js
kubernetes.listCoreV1PodForAllNamespaces({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Output

### watchCoreV1LimitRangeListForAllNamespaces
watch individual changes to a list of LimitRange


```js
kubernetes.watchCoreV1LimitRangeListForAllNamespaces({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.

  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * name **required** `string`: name of the PersistentVolumeClaim
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Output

  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results.

  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

### deleteApiextensionsV1beta1CollectionCustomResourceDefinition
delete collection of CustomResourceDefinition


```js
kubernetes.deleteApiextensionsV1beta1CollectionCustomResourceDefinition({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

### listAppsV1ReplicaSetForAllNamespaces
list or watch objects of kind ReplicaSet


```js

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

### watchAppsV1beta1StatefulSetListForAllNamespaces
watch individual changes to a list of StatefulSet


```js
kubernetes.watchAppsV1beta1StatefulSetListForAllNamespaces({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history.

  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available.

  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Output
* output [io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.WatchEvent](#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.watchevent)

### watchAppsV1beta2StatefulSetListForAllNamespaces
watch individual changes to a list of StatefulSet


```js
kubernetes.watchAppsV1beta2StatefulSetListForAllNamespaces({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field.

  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results.

When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * name **required** `string`: name of the HorizontalPodAutoscaler
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

### listBatchV1beta1NamespacedCronJob
list or watch objects of kind CronJob


```js
kubernetes.listBatchV1beta1NamespacedCronJob({
  "namespace": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

### listEventsV1beta1EventForAllNamespaces
list or watch objects of kind Event


```js
kubernetes.listEventsV1beta1EventForAllNamespaces({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Output

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.

### listExtensionsV1beta1NamespacedIngress
list or watch objects of kind Ingress


```js
kubernetes.listExtensionsV1beta1NamespacedIngress({
  "namespace": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.

  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results.

### deletePolicyV1beta1CollectionNamespacedPodDisruptionBudget
delete collection of PodDisruptionBudget


```js
kubernetes.deletePolicyV1beta1CollectionNamespacedPodDisruptionBudget({

```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available.

  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

### deleteRbacAuthorizationV1alpha1CollectionClusterRole
delete collection of ClusterRole


```js
kubernetes.deleteRbacAuthorizationV1alpha1CollectionClusterRole({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

### deleteRbacAuthorizationV1beta1CollectionNamespacedRole
delete collection of Role


```js
kubernetes.deleteRbacAuthorizationV1beta1CollectionNamespacedRole({
  "namespace": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

  * namespace **required** `string`: object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

* input `object`
  * continue `string`: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

#### Output

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
  * fieldSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
  * includeUninitialized `boolean`: If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
  * labelSelector `string`: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
  * limit `integer`: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
  * resourceVersion `string`: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
  * timeoutSeconds `integer`: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
  * watch `boolean`: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
  * pretty `string`: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
  * externalIPs `array`: externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes.  The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP.  A common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes system.
    * items `string`
  * externalName `string`: externalName is the external reference that kubedns or equivalent will return as a CNAME record for this service. No proxying will be involved. Must be a valid RFC-1123 hostname (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires Type to be ExternalName.
  * externalTrafficPolicy `string`: externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service desires to route external traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints. "Local" preserves the client source IP and avoids a second hop for LoadBalancer and Nodeport type services, but risks potentially imbalanced traffic spreading. "Cluster" obscures the client source IP and may cause a second hop to another node, but should have good overall load-spreading.
  * healthCheckNodePort `integer`: healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service. If not specified, HealthCheckNodePort is created by the service api backend with the allocated nodePort. Will use user-specified nodePort value if specified by the client. Only effects when Type is set to LoadBalancer and ExternalTrafficPolicy is set to Local.
  * loadBalancerIP `string`: Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer LoadBalancer will get created with the IP specified in this field. This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.
  * loadBalancerSourceRanges `array`: If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature." More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-cloud-provider-firewall/
    * items `string`
  * ports `array`: The list of ports that are exposed by this service. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
    * items [io.k8s.api.core.v1.ServicePort](#io.k8s.api.core.v1.serviceport)
  * publishNotReadyAddresses `boolean`: publishNotReadyAddresses, when set to true, indicates that DNS implementations must publish the notReadyAddresses of subsets for the Endpoints associated with the Service. The default value is false. The primary use case for setting this field is to use a StatefulSet's Headless Service to propagate SRV records for its Pods without respect to their readiness for purpose of peer discovery. This field will replace the service.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerate-unready-endpoints when that annotation is deprecated and all clients have been converted to use this field.
  * selector `object`: Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching this selector. If empty or not present, the service is assumed to have an external process managing its endpoints, which Kubernetes will not modify. Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is ExternalName. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/
  * sessionAffinity `string`: Supports "ClientIP" and "None". Used to maintain session affinity. Enable client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to None. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
  * sessionAffinityConfig [io.k8s.api.core.v1.SessionAffinityConfig](#io.k8s.api.core.v1.sessionaffinityconfig)
  * type `string`: type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. "ExternalName" maps to the specified externalName. "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a stable IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the clusterIP.
