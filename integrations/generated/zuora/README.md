## Access to the API

If you have a Zuora tenant, you can access the Zuora REST API via one of the following endpoints:

| Tenant              | Base URL for REST Endpoints |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|US Production | https://rest.zuora.com   |
|US API Sandbox    | https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com|
|US Performance Test | https://rest.pt1.zuora.com |
|US Production Copy | Submit a request at <a href="http://support.zuora.com/" target="_blank">Zuora Global Support</a> to enable the Zuora REST API in your tenant and obtain the base URL for REST endpoints. See [REST endpoint base URL of Production Copy (Service) Environment for existing and new customers](https://community.zuora.com/t5/API/REST-endpoint-base-URL-of-Production-Copy-Service-Environment/td-p/29611) for more information. |
|US Cloud Production | 	https://rest.na.zuora.com |
|US Cloud API Sandbox | 	https://rest.sandbox.na.zuora.com |
|US Central Sandbox | 	https://rest.test.zuora.com |    
|EU Production | https://rest.eu.zuora.com |
|EU API Sandbox | https://rest.sandbox.eu.zuora.com |
|EU Central Sandbox | 	https://rest.test.eu.zuora.com |

The Production endpoint provides access to your live user data. Sandbox tenants are a good place to test code without affecting real-world data. If you would like Zuora to provision a Sandbox tenant for you, contact your Zuora representative for assistance.


If you do not have a Zuora tenant, go to <a href="https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive" target="_blank">https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive</a> and sign up for a Production Test Drive tenant. The tenant comes with seed data, including a sample product catalog.

# Authentication

## OAuth v2.0

Zuora recommends that you use OAuth v2.0 to authenticate to the Zuora REST API. Currently, OAuth is not available in every environment. See [Zuora Testing Environments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/D_Zuora_Environments) for more information.

Zuora recommends you to create a dedicated API user with API write access on a tenant when authenticating via OAuth, and then create an OAuth client for this user. See <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User" target="_blank">Create an API User</a> for how to do this. By creating a dedicated API user, you can control permissions of the API user without affecting other non-API users.

If a user is deactivated, all of the user's OAuth clients will be automatically deactivated.

Authenticating via OAuth requires the following steps:
1. Create a Client
2. Generate a Token
3. Make Authenticated Requests

### Create a Client

You must first [create an OAuth client](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users#Create_an_OAuth_Client_for_a_User) in the Zuora UI. To do this, you must be an administrator of your Zuora tenant. This is a one-time operation. You will be provided with a Client ID and a Client Secret. Please note this information down, as it will be required for the next step.

**Note:** The OAuth client will be owned by a Zuora user account. If you want to perform PUT, POST, or DELETE operations using the OAuth client, the owner of the OAuth client must have a Platform role that includes the "API Write Access" permission.

### Generate a Token

After creating a client, you must make a call to obtain a bearer token using the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) operation. This operation requires the following parameters:
- `client_id` - the Client ID displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step
- `client_secret` - the Client Secret displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step
- `grant_type` - must be set to `client_credentials`

**Note**: The Client ID and Client Secret mentioned above were displayed when you created the OAuth Client in the prior step. The [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) response specifies how long the bearer token is valid for. You should reuse the bearer token until it is expired. When the token is expired, call [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) again to generate a new one.

### Make Authenticated Requests

To authenticate subsequent API requests, you must provide a valid bearer token in an HTTP header:

`Authorization: Bearer {bearer_token}`

If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Entities) enabled, you need to set an additional header to specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. You can use the `scope` field in the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) response to determine whether you need to specify an entity ID.

If the `scope` field contains more than one entity ID, you must specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. For example, if the `scope` field contains `entity.1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc` and `entity.c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`, specify one of the following headers:
- `Zuora-Entity-Ids: 1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc`
- `Zuora-Entity-Ids: c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`

**Note**: For a limited period of time, Zuora will accept the `entityId` header as an alternative to the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` header. If you choose to set the `entityId` header, you must remove all "-" characters from the entity ID in the `scope` field.

If the `scope` field contains a single entity ID, you do not need to specify an entity ID.

## Other Supported Authentication Schemes

Zuora continues to support the following additional legacy means of authentication:

  * Use username and password. Include authentication with each request in the header: 
  
    * `apiAccessKeyId` 
    * `apiSecretAccessKey`
    
    Zuora recommends that you create an API user specifically for making API calls. See <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User" target="_blank">Create an API User</a> for more information.
  
  * Use an authorization cookie. The cookie authorizes the user to make calls to the REST API for the duration specified in  **Administration > Security Policies > Session timeout**. The cookie expiration time is reset with this duration after every call to the REST API. To obtain a cookie, call the [Connections](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Connections) resource with the following API user information: 
  
    *   ID    
    *   Password
    
  * For CORS-enabled APIs only: Include a 'single-use' token in the request header, which re-authenticates the user with each request. See below for more details.

### Entity Id and Entity Name

The `entityId` and `entityName` parameters are only used for [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity "Zuora Multi-entity"). These are the legacy parameters that Zuora will only continue to support for a period of time. Zuora recommends you to use the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` parameter instead.


The  `entityId` and `entityName` parameters specify the Id and the [name of the entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/B_Introduction_to_Entity_and_Entity_Hierarchy#Name_and_Display_Name "Introduction to Entity and Entity Hierarchy") that you want to access, respectively. Note that you must have permission to access the entity. 

You can specify either the `entityId` or `entityName` parameter in the authentication to access and view an entity.

  * If both `entityId` and `entityName` are specified in the authentication, an error occurs. 
  * If neither `entityId` nor `entityName` is specified in the authentication, you will log in to the entity in which your user account is created. 


  

To get the entity Id and entity name, you can use the GET Entities REST call. For more information, see [API User Authentication](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/A_Overview_of_Multi-entity#API_User_Authentication "API User Authentication").
  
  ### Token Authentication for CORS-Enabled APIs
  
  The CORS mechanism enables REST API calls to Zuora to be made directly from your customer's browser, with all credit card and security information transmitted directly to Zuora. This minimizes your PCI compliance burden, allows you to implement advanced validation on your payment forms, and  makes your payment forms look just like any other part of your website.


  
For security reasons, instead of using cookies, an API request via CORS uses **tokens** for authentication.

The token method of authentication is only designed for use with requests that must originate from your customer's browser; **it should  not be considered a replacement to the existing cookie authentication** mechanism.

See [Zuora CORS REST](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/C_REST_API/Zuora_CORS_REST "Zuora CORS REST") for details on how CORS works and how you can begin to implement customer calls to the Zuora REST APIs. See  [HMAC Signatures](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POSTHMACSignature "HMAC Signatures") for details on the HMAC method that returns the authentication token.

# Requests and Responses

## Request IDs 
As a general rule, when asked to supply a "key" for an account or subscription (accountKey, account-key, subscriptionKey, subscription-key), you can provide either the actual ID or  the number of the entity.

## HTTP Request Body

Most of the parameters and data accompanying your requests will be contained in the body of the HTTP request. 

The Zuora REST API accepts JSON in the HTTP request body. No other data format (e.g., XML) is supported.

### Data Type

([Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Actions) and CRUD operations only) We recommend that you do not specify the decimal values with quotation marks, commas, and spaces. Use characters of `+-0-9.eE`, for example, `5`, `1.9`, `-8.469`, and `7.7e2`. Also, Zuora does not convert currencies for decimal values.

## Testing a Request

Use a third party client, such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se "curl"), [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com "Postman"), or [Advanced REST Client](https://advancedrestclient.com "Advanced REST Client"), to test the Zuora REST API.

You can test the Zuora REST API from the Zuora API Sandbox or Production tenants. If connecting to Production, bear in mind that you are working with your live production data, not sample data or test data.

## Testing with Credit Cards

Sooner or later it will probably be necessary to test some transactions that involve credit cards. For suggestions on how to handle this, see [Going Live With Your Payment Gateway](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards "C_Zuora_User_Guides/A_Billing_and_Payments/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards"
).

## Concurrent Request Limits

Zuora enforces tenant-level concurrent request limits. See <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits" target="_blank">Concurrent Request Limits</a> for more information.

## Timeout Limit

If a request does not complete within 120 seconds, the request times out and Zuora returns a Gateway Timeout error.


# Error Handling

If a request to Zuora Billing REST API with an endpoint starting with `/v1` (except [Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Actions) and CRUD operations) fails, the response will contain an eight-digit error code with a corresponding error message to indicate the details of the error.

The following code snippet is a sample error response that contains an error code and message pair:

```
 {
   "success": false,
   "processId": "CBCFED6580B4E076",
   "reasons":  [
     {
      "code": 53100320,
      "message": "'termType' value should be one of: TERMED, EVERGREEN"
     }
    ]
 }
```
The `success` field indicates whether the API request has succeeded. The `processId` field is a Zuora internal ID that you can provide to Zuora Global Support for troubleshooting purposes.

The `reasons` field contains the actual error code and message pair. The error code begins with `5` or `6` means that you encountered a certain issue that is specific to a REST API resource in Zuora Billing. For example, `53100320` indicates that an invalid value is specified for the `termType` field of the `subscription` object.

The error code beginning with `9` usually indicates that an authentication-related issue occurred, and it can also indicate other unexpected errors depending on different cases. For example, `90000011` indicates that an invalid credential is provided in the request header. 

When troubleshooting the error, you can divide the error code into two components: REST API resource code and error category code. See the following Zuora error code sample:

<a href="https://assets.zuora.com/zuora-documentation/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://assets.zuora.com/zuora-documentation/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg" alt="Zuora Error Code Sample"></a>


**Note:** Zuora determines resource codes based on the request payload. Therefore, if GET and DELETE requests that do not contain payloads fail, you will get `500000` as the resource code, which indicates an unknown object and an unknown field. 
The error category code of these requests is valid and follows the rules described in the [Error Category Code](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Error-Handling/Error-Category-Code) section. 
In such case, you can refer to the returned error message to troubleshoot.


## REST API Resource Code

The 6-digit resource code indicates the REST API resource, typically a field of a Zuora object, on which the issue occurs. In the preceding example, `531003` refers to the `termType` field of the `subscription` object. 

The value range for all REST API resource codes is from `500000` to `679999`. See [Resource Codes](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API/AA_REST_API/Resource_Codes) in the Knowledge Center for a full list of resource codes.

## Error Category Code

The 2-digit error category code identifies the type of error, for example, resource not found or missing required field. 

The following table describes all error categories and the corresponding resolution:

| Code    | Error category              | Description    | Resolution    |
|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| 10      | Permission or access denied | The request cannot be processed because a certain tenant or user permission is missing. | Check the missing tenant or user permission in the response message and contact [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com) for enablement. |
| 11      | Authentication failed       | Authentication fails due to invalid API authentication credentials. | Ensure that a valid API credential is specified. |
| 20      | Invalid format or value     | The request cannot be processed due to an invalid field format or value. | Check the invalid field in the error message, and ensure that the format and value of all fields you passed in are valid. |
| 21      | Unknown field in request    | The request cannot be processed because an unknown field exists in the request body. | Check the unknown field name in the response message, and ensure that you do not include any unknown field in the request body. |
| 22      | Missing required field      | The request cannot be processed because a required field in the request body is missing. | Check the missing field name in the response message, and ensure that you include all required fields in the request body. |
| 30      | Rule restriction            | The request cannot be processed due to the violation of a Zuora business rule. | Check the response message and ensure that the API request meets the specified business rules. |
| 40      | Not found                   | The specified resource cannot be found. | Check the response message and ensure that the specified resource exists in your Zuora tenant. |
| 45      | Unsupported request         | The requested endpoint does not support the specified HTTP method. | Check your request and ensure that the endpoint and method matches. |
| 50      | Locking contention          | This request cannot be processed because the objects this request is trying to modify are being modified by another API request, UI operation, or batch job process. | <p>Resubmit the request first to have another try.</p> <p>If this error still occurs, contact [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com) with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance.</p> |
| 60      | Internal error              | The server encounters an internal error. | Contact [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com) with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance. |
| 70      | Request exceeded limit      | The total number of concurrent requests exceeds the limit allowed by the system. | <p>Resubmit the request after the number of seconds specified by the `Retry-After` value in the response header.</p> <p>Check [Concurrent request limits](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits) for details about Zuora’s concurrent request limit policy.</p> |
| 90      | Malformed request           | The request cannot be processed due to JSON syntax errors. | Check the syntax error in the JSON request body and ensure that the request is in the correct JSON format. |
| 99      | Integration error           | The server encounters an error when communicating with an external system, for example, payment gateway, tax engine provider. | Check the response message and take action accordingly. |


# Pagination

When retrieving information (using GET methods), the optional `pageSize` query parameter sets the maximum number of rows to return in a response. The maximum is `40`; larger values are treated as `40`. If this value is empty or invalid, `pageSize` typically defaults to `10`.

The default value for the maximum number of rows retrieved can be overridden at the method level.

If more rows are available, the response will include a `nextPage` element, which contains a URL for requesting the next page.  If this value is not provided, no more rows are available. No "previous page" element is explicitly provided; to support backward paging, use the previous call.

## Array Size

For data items that are not paginated, the REST API supports arrays of up to 300 rows.  Thus, for instance, repeated pagination can retrieve thousands of customer accounts, but within any account an array of no more than 300 rate plans is returned.

# API Versions

The Zuora REST API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora REST API changes are backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the API.

## Major Version

The major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. Currently, Zuora only supports the **v1** major version. For example, `POST https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions`.

## Minor Version

Zuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to replace it. 

Some fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request header to process without an error. 

If a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions. For example, the `invoiceCollect` field in the POST Subscription method is in version control and its maximum minor version is 189.0. You can only use this field with the minor version 189.0 or earlier.

If you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we note that in the field description.

You only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request call. For example, the `collect` field is in 196.0 minor version. If you want to use this field for the POST Subscription method, set the  `zuora-version` parameter to `196.0` in the request header. The `zuora-version` parameter is case sensitive.

For all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not specified in the request header, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API to avoid breaking your integration. 

### Minor Version History

The supported minor versions are not serial. This section documents the changes made to each Zuora REST API minor version.

The following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a Zuora REST API minor version.

| Fields         | Minor Version      | REST Methods    | Description |

## API Names

You can use the [Describe object](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_Describe) operation to list the fields of each Zuora object that is available in your tenant. When you call the operation, you must specify the API name of the Zuora object.

The following table provides the API name of each Zuora object:

## Actions

### GET_ChargeMetrics
Retrieves key charge metrics about rate plan charges that have changes in a specified time range.

The purpose of `fromTimestamp` and `toTimestamp` is to synchronize charge metrics data incrementally. 



```js
zuora.GET_ChargeMetrics({
  "fromTimestamp": "",
  "toTimestamp": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * Zuora-Track-Id `string`: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.
  * Zuora-Entity-Ids `string`: An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.
  * Accept `string`: Expressed as MIME types that the client is able to understand. Using content negotiation, the server then selects one of the proposals, uses it and informs the client of its choice with the `Content-Type` response header. The possible response MIME types are `application/json-seq` compatible with http://jsonlines.org/, and `text/csv` compatible with RFC 4180. `application/json-seq` is the default response MIME type. If the `Accept` header is not sepecified, or set */*, the response body is returned in application/json-seq MIME type.
  * fromTimestamp **required** `string`: The starting date and time of a time range when changes are made to charge metrics, in `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ` format. For example, `2020-08-18T09:01:11Z`. The timestamp maps to the `UpdatedOn` timestamp of the to-be-exported object.
  * toTimestamp **required** `string`: The end date and time of a time range when changes are made to charge metrics, in `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ` format. For example, `2020-08-20T09:01:11Z`. The timestamp maps to the `UpdatedOn` timestamp of the to-be-exported object.

#### Output
* output [ChargeMetricsResponse](#chargemetricsresponse)

```js
zuora.GET_EventTriggers({
  "Authorization": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * Authorization **required** `string`: `Bearer {token}` for a valid OAuth token.
  * Zuora-Entity-Ids `string`: An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.
  * Zuora-Track-Id `string`: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.
  * baseObject `string`: The Zuora object that trigger condition is defined upon. Should be specified in the pattern: ^[A-Z][\\w\\-]*$
  * eventTypeName `string`: The event type name. Should be specified in the pattern: ^[A-Za-z]{1,}[\w\-]*$
  * active `string`: The status of the event trigger.
  * start `integer`: The first index of the query result. Default to 0 if absent, and the minimum is 0.
  * limit `integer`: The maximum number of data records to be returned. Default to 10 if absent.

#### Output
* output `object`
  * data `array`
    * items [EventTrigger](#eventtrigger)
  * next `string`: The link to the next page. No value if it is last page.

### POST_EventTrigger
When you create an event trigger, you must specify the base object and define the trigger condition.

### Specify the base object
Use `baseObject` field to specify which object to define a trigger on. You can define an event trigger on any of the following objects:

  * Account
  * AccountingCode
  * AccountingPeriod
  * Amendment
  * BillingRun
  * Contact
  * CreditBalanceAdjustment
  * CreditMemo
  * CreditMemoApplication
  * CreditMemoApplicationItem
  * CreditMemoItem
  * DebitMemo
  * DebitMemoItem
  * Feature
  * Invoice
  * InvoiceAdjustment
  * InvoiceItem
  * InvoiceItemAdjustment
  * JournalEntry
  * JournalEntryItem
  * Order
  * OrderAction
  * Payment
  * PaymentApplication
  * PaymentMethod
  * PaymentPart
  * Product
  * ProductFeature
  * ProductRatePlan
  * ProductRatePlanCharge
  * RatePlan
  * RatePlanCharge
  * Refund
  * RefundApplication
  * RevenueEvent
  * RevenueEventItem
  * RevenueSchedule
  * RevenueScheduleItem
  * Subscription
  * SubscriptionProductFeature
  * TaxationItem
  * Usage

#### Tenant level base objects and tenant level event triggers
Zuora identifies the following base objects as the tenant level base objects:

  * AccountingCode
  * AccountingPeriod
  * BillingRun
  * Feature
  * JournalEntry
  * JournalEntryItem
  * Product
  * ProductFeature
  * ProductRatePlan
  * ProductRatePlanCharge

Event triggers defined on tenant level base objects are tenant level event triggers. Notifications associated with tenant level events are system notifications. 

**Note:** Tenant level event triggers and system notifications are only available in the default profile.        

### Define the trigger condition
The `condition` field is a [JEXL](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/) expression that specifies when to trigger events. The expression can contain fields from the object that the trigger is defined on.

**Note:** The condition cannot contain fields from [data source](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL) objects that are joined to the object that the trigger is defined on.

For example, the following condition causes an event to be triggered whenever an invoice is posted with an amount greater than 1000:

```changeType == 'UPDATE' && Invoice.Status == 'Posted' && Invoice.Status_old != 'Posted' && Invoice.Amount > 1000```

Where:

  * `changeType` is a keyword that specifies the type of change that occurred to the Invoice object. For all objects, the supported values of `changeType` are `INSERT`, `UPDATE`,  and `DELETE`.
  * `Invoice.Status` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field after the change occurred.
  * `Invoice.Status_old` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field before the change occurred.

In the above example, the value of `baseObject` is `Invoice`.

### Limitations 

This event trigger has the following limitations:

* The maximum number of event triggers is 20. If you want to increase the limit, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com).

* The INSERT change type is not supported on RatePlan base objects.

* The INSERT change type is not supported on SubscriptionProductFeature base objects.

* The UPDATE change type based on custom fields of base objects is not supported.

### POST_Account
Creates a customer account with a payment method, a bill-to contact, and an optional sold-to contact. Request and response field descriptions and sample code are provided. Use this operation to optionally create a subscription, invoice for that subscription, and collect payment through the default payment method. The transaction is atomic; if any part fails for any reason, the entire transaction is rolled back.

This operation is CORS Enabled, so you can use client-side Javascript to invoke the call. 

## Notes
1. The account is created in active status.  
2. If the `autoPay` field is set to `true` in the request, you must provide one of the `paymentMethod`, `creditCard`, or `hpmCreditCardPaymentMethodId` field, but not multiple. The one provided becomes the default payment method for this account. If the credit card information is declined or cannot be verified, no account is created.
3. Customer accounts created with this call are automatically be set to Auto Pay.
4. If either the `workEmail` or `personalEmail` field is specified, then the account's email delivery preference is automatically set to `true`. (In that case, emails go to the `workEmail` address, if it exists, or else the `personalEmail`.) If neither field is specified, the email delivery preference is automatically set to `false`.

## Defaults for customerAcceptanceDate and serviceActivationDate
Default values for **customerAcceptanceDate** and **serviceActivationDate** are set as follows.

|        | serviceActivationDate(SA) specified          | serviceActivationDate (SA) NOT specified  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| customerAcceptanceDate (CA) specified      | SA uses value in the request call; CA uses value in the request call| CA uses value in the request call;SA uses CE as default |
| customerAcceptanceDate (CA) NOT specified      | SA uses value in the request call; CA uses SA as default |   SA and CA use CE as default |

### Action_POSTamend
Modifies a subscription by creating Amendment objects. However, to modify a subscription, Zuora recommends that you use [Update subscription](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_Subscription) instead of this action. 

The Amend action cannot modify the custom fields on the Subscription object. You must use [Update subscription](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_Subscription) or [Update subscription custom fields of a specified subscription version](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_UpdateSubscriptionCustomFieldsOfASpecifiedVersion) to modify the custom fields on the Subscription object.

You can use this action to create up to 10 Amendment objects. You must specify the following fields for each Amendment object:

* `ContractEffectiveDate`
* `Name`
* `SubscriptionId`
* `Type`

Additionally, the value of `SubscriptionId` must be the same for each Amendment object. You cannot use this operation to update multiple subscriptions.

**Note:** When you call this operation, Zuora modifies the subscription in the order that you specify Amendment objects in the request body.

If Zuora is unable to create an Amendment object when you call this operation, the entire call fails.

### Action_POSTquery
The query call sends a query expression by specifying the object to query, the fields to retrieve from that object, and any filters to determine whether a given object should be queried.


You can use [Zuora Object Query Language](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/K_Zuora_Object_Query_Language) (ZOQL) to construct those queries, passing them through the `queryString`.


Once the call is made, the API executes the query against the specified object and returns a query response object to your application. Your application can then iterate through rows in the query response to retrieve information.

## Limitations 

This call has the following limitations:

* All ZOQL keywords must be in lower case.
* The number of records returned is limited to 2000 records
* The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.

### Action_POSTqueryMore
Use queryMore to request additional results from a previous query call. If your initial query call returns more than 2000 results, you can use queryMore to query for the additional results.


Any `queryLocator` results greater than 2,000, will only be stored by Zuora for 5 days before it is deleted.


 This call sends a request for additional results from an initial query call. If the initial query call returns more than 2000 results, you can use the `queryLocator` returned from query to request the next set of results.


**Note:** Zuora expires queryMore cursors after 15 minutes of activity.


To use queryMore, you first construct a query call. By default, the query call will return up to 2000 results. If there are more than 2000 results, query will return a boolean `done`, which will be marked as `false`, and a `queryLocator`, which is a marker you will pass to queryMore to get the next set of results.

### Action_POSTsubscribe

This call performs many actions.  Use the subscribe call to bundle information required to create at least one new subscription.

The call takes in an array of SubscribeRequests. Because it takes an array, you can submit a batch of subscription requests at once. You can create up to 50 different subscriptions in a single subscribe call.

This is a combined call that you can use to perform all of the following tasks in a single call:

* Create accounts
* Create contacts
* Create payment methods, including external payment options
* Create an invoice for the subscription
* Apply the first payment to a subscription

## Object Limits 
50 objects are supported in a single call.



## Effective Date
If the effective date is in the future, the invoices will not be generated, and there will be no invoice number.

## Subscription Name, Number, and ID 
### Subscription Name and Number 
The subscription name is a unique identifier for the subscription. If you do not specify a value for the name, Zuora will create one automatically. The automatically generated value is known as the subscription number, such as `A-S00000080`. You cannot change the subscription name or number after creating the subscription. 

* **Subscription name**: The name that you set for the subscription.
* **Subscription number**: The value generated by Zuora automatically if you do not specify a subscription name. 

Both the subscription name and number must be unique. If they are not, an error will occur.

### Subscription ID 
The subscription ID is a 32-digit ID in the format 4028xxxx. This is also the unique identifier for a subscription. This value is automatically generated by the system and cannot be edited or updated, but it can be queried. One subscription can have only one subscription name or number, but it can have multiple IDs: Each version of a subscription has a different ID.

The Subscription object contains the fields `OriginalId` and `PreviousSubscriptionId`. `OriginalId` is the ID for the first version of a subscription. `PreviousSubscriptionId` is the ID of the version created immediately prior to the current version.

## Subscription Preview 
You can preview invoices that would be generated by the subscribe call. 

## Invoice Subscriptions Separately
If you have enabled the invoice subscriptions separately feature, a subscribe call will generate an invoice for each subscription for every subscription where the field `IsInvoiceSeparate` is set to `true`.

If the invoice subscriptions separately feature is disabled, a subscribe call will generate a single invoice for all subscriptions.

See [Invoicing Subscriptions Separately](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Subscriptions/B_Creating_Subscriptions/Invoicing_Subscriptions_Separately) for more information.

## Subscriptions and Draft Invoices 
If a draft invoice that includes charges exists in a customer account, using the subscribe call to create a new subscription and generate an invoice will cause the new subscription to be added to the existing draft invoice. Zuora will then post the invoice. 

## When to Use Subscribe and Create Calls 
You can use either the subscribe call or the create call to create the objects associated with a subscription (accounts, contacts, and so on). There are differences between these calls, however, and some situations are better for one or the other.

### Use the Subscribe Call 
The subscribe call bundles up all the information you need for a subscription. Use the subscribe call to create new subscriptions when you have all the information you need.

Subscribe calls cannot update BillTo, SoldTo, and Account objects. Payment information objects cannot be updated if there is an existing account ID in the call. These objects are not supported in a subscribe call.

### Use the Create Call 
The create call is more useful when you want to develop in stages. For example, if you want to first create an account, then a contact, and so on. If you do not have all information available, use the create call. To create a subscription, you must activate the account from Draft status to Active by calling the subscribe call.



```js
zuora.Action_POSTsubscribe({
  "body": {
    "subscribes": []
  }
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * rejectUnknownFields `boolean`: Specifies whether the call fails if the request body contains unknown fields.
  * Zuora-Entity-Ids `string`: An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.
  * Zuora-Track-Id `string`: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.
  * X-Zuora-WSDL-Version `string`: Zuora WSDL version number.
  * body **required** [ProxyActionsubscribeRequest](#proxyactionsubscriberequest)

#### Output
* output `array`
  * items [SubscribeResult](#subscriberesult)

### Action_POSTupdate

Updates the information in one or more objects of the same type. You can specify different types of objects in different update calls, but each specific update call must apply to only one type of object.

You can update an array of one or more zObjects. It returns an array of SaveResults, indicating the success or failure of updating each object. The following information applies to this call:

* You cannot pass in null zObjects.
* You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time.
* All objects must be of the same type.
* For each field in each object, you must determine that object's ID. Then populate the fields that you want update with the new information.
* Zuora ignores unrecognized fields in update calls. For example, if an optional field is spelled incorrectly or a field that does not exist is specified, Zuora ignores the field and continues to process the call. No error message is returned for unrecognized fields.

## Limitations 

This call has the following limitations:

* A maximum of 50 objects are supported in a single call.
* The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.
* The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. To update objects or fields according to a different WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` header. To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).

Credit memos are only available if you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled.


Using this API operation, the billing documents are sent to the email addresses specified in the **To Email** field of the email templates. The email template used for each billing document is set in the **Delivery Options** panel of the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. See [Edit Email Templates](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/Create_Email_Templates) for more information about how to edit the **To Email** field in the email template.





## Notes
  - Even though no field is required in the Request body, you still need to specify `{}` in the request. Otherwise, an error will be returned.


  - You can only email posted billing documents.
  
  
  - You must activate the following notifications before emailing invoices and credit memos:
    - **Manual Email For Invoice | Manual Email For Invoice** 
    - **Email Credit Memo | Manually email Credit Memo**
 
  
  - To include the invoice PDF in the email, select the **Include Invoice PDF** check box in the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. To include the credit memo PDF in the email, select the **Include Credit Memo PDF** check box in the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. See [Create and Edit Notifications](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/C_Create_Notifications#section_2) for more information.

### POST_Connections
Establishes a connection to the Zuora REST API service based on a valid user credentials. 

**Note:**This is a legacy REST API. Zuora recommends you to use [OAuth](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Authentication/OAuth-v2.0) for authentication instead. 

This call authenticates the user and returns an API session cookie that's used to authorize subsequent calls to the REST API. The credentials must belong to a user account that has permission to access the API service.

As noted elsewhere, it's strongly recommended that an account used for Zuora API activity is never used to log into the Zuora UI.  Once an account is used to log into the UI, it may be subject to periodic forced password changes, which may eventually lead to authentication failures when using the API.



```js
zuora.POST_Connections({
  "apiAccessKeyId": "",
  "apiSecretAccessKey": "",
  "Content-Type": ""
}, context)

| `<label>`    | Name of the field in the Zuora user interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `<type>`     | Data type of the field. The possible data types are: `boolean`, `date`, `datetime`, `decimal`, `integer`, `picklist`, `text`, `timestamp`, and `ZOQL`. If the data type is `picklist`, the `<field>` element contains an `<options>` element that lists the possible values of the field.    |
| `<contexts>` | Specifies the availability of the field. If the `<contexts>` element lists the `export` context, the field is available for use in data source exports.                                                                                                                                                |

The `<field>` element contains other elements that provide legacy information about the field. This information is not directly related to the REST API.

Response sample:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<object>
  <name>ProductRatePlanCharge</name>
  <label>Product Rate Plan Charge</label>
  <fields>
    ...
    <field>
      <name>TaxMode</name>
      <label>Tax Mode</label>
      <type>picklist</type>
      <options>
        <option>TaxExclusive</option>
        <option>TaxInclusive</option>
      </options>
      <contexts>
        <context>export</context>
      </contexts>
      ...
    </field>
    ...
  </fields>
</object>
```

It is strongly recommended that your integration checks `<contexts>` elements in the response. If your integration does not check `<contexts>` elements, your integration may process fields that are not available for use in data source exports.

### PUT_JournalRun
This reference describes how to cancel a journal run using the REST API.
          
The summary journal entries in the journal run are canceled asynchronously. See the "Example" section below for details.
          
You must have the "Cancel Journal Run" Zuora Finance user permission enabled to cancel journal runs.

## Notes
When you cancel a journal run, the summary journal entries associated with that journal run are canceled asynchronously. A response of `{ "success": true }` means only that the specified journal run has a status of "Pending", "Error", or "Completed" and therefore can be canceled, but does not mean that the whole journal run was successfully canceled.

For example, let's say you want to cancel journal run JR-00000075. The journal run status is "Completed" and it contains ten journal entries. One of the journal entries has its Transferred to Accounting status set to "Yes", meaning that the entry cannot be canceled. The workflow might go as follows:
1. You make an API call to cancel the journal run.
2. The journal run status is "Completed", so you receive a response of `{ "success": true }`.
3. Zuora begins asynchronously canceling journal entries associated with the journal run. The journal entry whose Transferred to Accounting status is "Yes" fails to be canceled. The cancelation process continues, and the other journal entries are successfully canceled.
4. The journal run status remains as "Completed". The status does not change to "Canceled" because the journal run still contains a journey entry that is not canceled.

zuora.PUT_JournalRun({
  "jr-number": ""
}, context)
```

* input `object`
  * Zuora-Track-Id `string`: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers.

## Post a Bill Run

Posting a bill run is an asynchronous operation. To post a bill run, the current bill run must have a status of `Completed`.

When a bill run is posted, its status is changed to `PostInProgress`. Once all invoices for this bill run are posted then its status is changed to `Posted`.   

When you post a bill run and query the status of a bill run, you will get one of the following results `PostInProgress`, `Completed`, or `Posted`. If all invoices in the bill run are posted, then the status of the bill run is `Posted`. If one or more invoices fail to post, the status will change back to `Completed` and you will need to post the bill run again.

## Cancel a Bill Run

Canceling a bill run is an asynchronous operation. When canceling a bill run, the logic is the same as when using the UI to cancel a bill run. You need to provide the `BillRunId`, and set the Status to `Canceled`. 

When canceling a bill run, consider the following:

* Canceling a bill run with a `Completed` status.
  * Only the current bill run will be canceled.
* Canceling a bill run with a `Pending` status.
  * When canceling an Ad-hoc bill run, only the current bill run will be canceled.
  * When canceling a scheduled bill, all scheduled bill runs will be canceled.

The Cancel operation may not be successful. Its success depends on its current business validation. Only a bill run that has no posted invoices can be canceled. If any posted invoices belong to the bill run then an invalid value exception will be thrown with the message, "The Bill Run cannot be Cancelled, There are Posted invoices."

### POST_BillingPreview
**Note:** The Billing Preview feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/). 


Generates a preview of future invoice items for one customer account. Use the BillingPreview call to calculate how much a single customer will be invoiced from the most recent invoice to a specific end of term date in the future.

Additionally, you can use the BillingPreview service to access real-time data on an individual customer's usage consumption. 

The BillingPreview call does not calculate taxes for charges in the subscription.

If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, you can also generate a preview of future credit memo items for one customer account. The Invoice Settlement feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/). 



```js

### POST_TransactionInvoicePayment
Generates and posts invoices and credit memos and collects payments for posted invoices. Credit memos are only available if you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled and negative charges exist. Credit memos will not be applied to invoices. If draft invoices and credit memos exist when you run this operation, this operation will post the invoices and credit memos. Note that draft credit memos created from an invoice or a product rate plan charge will not be posted.

You can use this operation to generate invoices and collect payments on the posted invoices,
 or else simply collect payment on a specified existing
invoice. The customer's default payment method is used, and the full
amount due is collected. The operation depends on the parameters you
specify.

- To generate one or more new invoices for that customer and collect
payment on the generated and other unpaid invoice(s), leave the **invoiceId** field empty. 

- To collect payment on an existing invoice, specify the invoice ID. 


The operation is atomic; if any part is unsuccessful, the entire
operation is rolled back.

When an error occurs, gateway reason codes and error messages are returned the error response of this operation. The following items are some gateway response code examples.

- Orbital: `05 Do Not Honor`; `14 Invalid Credit Card Number`
- Vantiv: `301 Invalid Account Number`; `304 Lost/Stolen Card`  
- CyberSource2: `202 Expired card`; `231 Invalid account number`

For more reason code information, see the corresponding payment gateway documentation. 


## Notes

Timeouts may occur when using this method on an account that
has an extremely high number of subscriptions.

You can also see the [API Guides](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-guides/) for more use cases of the "Create order" operation.

Creating a draft order is currently not supported. See [Known Limitations in Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/C_Known_Limitations_in_Orders) for additional limitations.

Zuora has the following limits on the Orders synchronous API to prevent performance degradation: 
* Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) or [Preview order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.
* Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single [Create order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) or [Preview order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.
* Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) or [Preview order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.

If you have an Order that exceeds any limits of the above, Zuora recommends you use the following asynchronous API operations:
* [Create order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously)
* [Preview order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously)

Zuora has the following limits on the Orders asynchronous API operations to prevent performance degradation:
* Up to 300 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.
* Up to 300 order actions are allowed in a single [Create order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.
* Up to 300 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.

If you have a need for a large order that exceeds any limits of the above, you can request a limit increase for the Orders asynchronous API by submitting a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com).        

**Note:** When you are to suspend a subcription (via the `suspend` order action), if in the same "Create order" call you are to perform other subsequent order actions on the supscription to suspend, you must first resume the subscription (via a `resume` order action). 

**Note:** When using this operation to create an account, create a subscription, run billing, and collect payment in a single call, if any error occurs during the call, such as a payment processing failure and a tax engine failure, then all the other steps will be rolled back. This means that the invoice will not be generated, the subscription will not be created, and the account will not be created.



```js
zuora.POST_Order({
  "body": {
    "orderDate": "",
    "subscriptions": []
  }
}, context)

If the value of a filterable field is string, you can set the corresponding query parameter to `null` when filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`.

Examples:

- /v1/payments?status=Processed

- /v1/payments?currency=USD&status=Processed

- /v1/payments?status=Processed&type=External&sort=+number

### POST_Usage

This REST API reference describes how to post or import usage data for one or more accounts in the CSV format. There are no path or query parameters. The data is uploaded using the HTTP multipart/form-data POST method and applied to the user's tenant. 

For a use case of this operation, see [Upload usage records](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-guides/#Upload-usage-records).

## How this REST API Call Works
The content of the uploaded usage file must follow the format used by the UI import tool. It must be a comma-separated (CSV) file with a corresponding .csv extension. The length of the file name must not exceed 50 characters. The file size must not exceed 4MB. See [Downloading the Usage Template](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/J_Billing_Operations/Usage/C_Import_Usage_Data#Downloading_the_Usage_Template) to learn about how to download the usage file template.

At the completion of the upload, before the file contents are actually being processed, the API returns a response containing the byte count of the received file and a URL for checking the status of the import process.  Of the five possible results displayed at that URL (Pending, Processing, Completed, Canceled, and Failed) only a Completed status indicates that the import was successful.  The operation is atomic; if any record fails, the file is rejected. In that case, the entire import is rolled back and all stored data is returned to its original state.

To view the actual import status, enter the resulting status URL from the checkImportStatus response using a tool such as POSTMAN. This additional step provides more information about why the import has failed.

To manage the information after a successful upload, use the web-based UI.

## Usage File Format
The usage file uses the following headings: 

| Heading         | Description   | Required |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| ACCOUNT_ID      | Enter the account number, e.g., the default account number, such as A00000001, or your custom account number. Although this field is labeled as Account_Id, it is not the actual Account ID nor Account Name.  | Yes      |
| UOM             | Enter the unit of measure. This must match the UOM for the usage. | Yes      |
| QTY             | Enter the quantity.  | Yes      |
| STARTDATE       | Enter the start date of the usage. This date determines the invoice item service period the associated usage is billed to. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY`. | Yes |
| ENDDATE         | Enter the end date of the usage. This is not used in calculations for usage billing and is optional. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY`. <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required.</p> | No |
| SUBSCRIPTION_ID | Enter the subscription number or subscription name. If you created the subscription in the Zuora application, Zuora created a number automatically in a format similar to A-S00000001. If you do not provide a value for this field, the associated usage will be added to all subscriptions for the specified Account that use this Unit Of Measure. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record.  <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required.</p>  | No   |
| CHARGE_ID       | Enter the charge number (not the charge name). You can see the charge ID, e.g., C-00000001, when you add your rate plan to your subscription and view your individual charges. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the specific Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record. This field is related to the Charge Number on the subscription rate plan.  <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required.</p>  | No      |
| DESCRIPTION     | Enter a description for the charge. | No       |
