## Description

API to view feed information and download feeds from TransitFeeds.com


## Actions

### getFeedVersions
This API call allows you to easily see every single feed update in the TranstiFeeds.com system. Since this can be quite
long, it's also possible to filter this list by a single feed ID.



```js
transitfeeds.getFeedVersions({
  "key": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * key **required** `string`: Your personal API key, used for authentication.
  * feed `string`: If you only want to retrieve feed versions for a particular feed, include its ID here. You can use the `/getFeeds` call to discover feed IDs.
  * page `integer`: The page number of results to return. For example, if you specify a `page` of `2` with a `limit` of 10, then results 11-20 are returned.
  * limit `integer`: The maximum number of results to return..
  * err `integer` (values: 0, 1): To include any errors detected when importing this feed in the response, specify a valud of `1`.
  * warn `integer` (values: 0, 1): To include any warnings detected when importing this feed in the response, specify a valud of `1`.

#### Output
* output [GetFeedVersionsResponse](#getfeedversionsresponse)

### getFeeds
Used this API to retrieve a list of feeds in the system. Doing so can be usedful to discover feed IDs that
can be used in other API calls.



```js
transitfeeds.getFeeds({
  "key": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * key **required** `string`: Your personal API key, used for authentication.
  * location `integer`: This is the unique ID of a location. If specified, feeds will only be returned that belong to this location
  * descendants `integer` (values: 0, 1): If a location is specified in `location`, this flag can be used to control if returned feeds must be assigned directly to the location, or if feeds belonging to sub-locations can also be returned. If `0`, then feeds must be assigned directly to the specified location.
  * page `integer`: The page number of results to return. For example, if you specify a `page` of `2` with a `limit` of 10, then results 11-20 are returned.
  * limit `integer`: The maximum number of results to return..
  * type `string` (values: gtfs, gtfsrealtime): The type of feeds to return. If unspecified, feeds of all types are returned.

#### Output
* output [GetFeedsResponse](#getfeedsresponse)

### getLatestFeedVersion
Once you have used `/getFeeds` to discover a feed's URL, you can use this endpoint to download its latest version from TranstiFeeds.
It will be unmodified in the original format from the provider.



```js
transitfeeds.getLatestFeedVersion({
  "key": "",
  "feed": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * key **required** `string`: Your personal API key, used for authentication.
  * feed **required** `string`: The ID of the feed to retrieve the latest feed version for. You can use the `/getFeeds` call to discover feed IDs.

#### Output
* output [GetLatestFeedVersionResponse](#getlatestfeedversionresponse)

### getLocations
Retrieve a list of locations. Each location (except for the root) has a parent location, and each
location has zero or more child locations. This hierarchy is generally structured so countries contain
states, states contain cities (although this typically depends on the country).



```js
transitfeeds.getLocations({
  "key": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * key **required** `string`: Your personal API key, used for authentication.

#### Output
* output [GetLocationsResponse](#getlocationsresponse)
