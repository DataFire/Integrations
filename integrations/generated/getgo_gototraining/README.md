## Actions

### getAllOrganisers
DEPRECATED: Please use the Admin API call 'Get all users' instead. For details see https://goto-developer.logmein.com/get-all-users.


```js
getgo_gototraining.getAllOrganisers({
  "Authorization": "",
  "accountKey": 0
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * Authorization **required** `string`: Access token
  * accountKey **required** `integer`: The key of the multi-user account

#### Output
* output `array`
  * items [Organizer](#organizer)

### getAllTrainings
This call retrieves information on all scheduled trainings for a given organizer. The trainings are returned in the order in which they were created. Completed trainings are not included; ongoing trainings with past sessions are included along with the past sessions. If the organizer does not have any scheduled trainings, the response will be empty.


```js
getgo_gototraining.getAllTrainings({
  "Authorization": "",
  "organizerKey": 0
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * Authorization **required** `string`: Access token
  * organizerKey **required** `integer`: The key of the training organizer

#### Output
* output `array`
  * items [Training](#training)

### scheduleTraining
Schedules a training of one or more sessions. The call requires a training's name, at least one start and end time, and optionally may include additional sessions, a description, additional organizers (presenters), and registration settings. You can only add organizers to a training if you have a multi-user account. Once a training has been created with this method, you can accept registrations to the training. Registration is for the entire training - all sessions. (The GoToTraining admin site enables you to create trainings that allow participants to register for individual sessions as well as automatically create weekly or monthly events.) Registration settings controls whether you allow web registration for this training, and whether a confirmation email is sent to the registrant following registration. Disabling the confirmation email is an API-only setting. If the user registers through the GoToTraining website, a confirmation email is sent. If the user is manually approved by the training administrator through the GoToTraining web site, the confirmation email is sent. It is recommended that you disable web registration if you disable confirmation emails. The response contains a trainingKey for the scheduled training.


```js
getgo_gototraining.scheduleTraining({
  "Authorization": "",
  "organizerKey": 0,
  "body": null
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
