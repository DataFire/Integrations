## Description

API for spectrum-management functions.

## Actions

### paws.getSpectrum
Requests information about the available spectrum for a device at a location. Requests from a fixed-mode device must include owner information so the device can be registered with the database.


```js
google_spectrum.paws.getSpectrum({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * body [PawsGetSpectrumRequest](#pawsgetspectrumrequest)
  * alt `string` (values: csv, json): Data format for the response.

  * startHz `number`: The required inclusive start of the frequency range (in Hertz).
  * stopHz `number`: The required exclusive end of the frequency range (in Hertz).

### GeoLocation
* GeoLocation `object`: This parameter is used to specify the geolocation of the device.
  * confidence `integer`: The location confidence level, as an integer percentage, may be required, depending on the regulatory domain. When the parameter is optional and not provided, its value is assumed to be 95. Valid values range from 0 to 99, since, in practice, 100-percent confidence is not achievable.

At least one location must be included. Geolocation must be given as the location of the radiation center of the device's antenna. If a location specifies a region, rather than a point, the database may return an UNIMPLEMENTED error if it does not support query by region.
    * items [GeoLocation](#geolocation)
  * masterDeviceDesc [DeviceDescriptor](#devicedescriptor)
  * owner [DeviceOwner](#deviceowner)
  * requestType `string`: The request type parameter is an optional parameter that can be used to modify an available spectrum batch request, but its use depends on applicable regulatory rules. For example, It may be used to request generic slave device parameters without having to specify the device descriptor for a specific device. When the requestType parameter is missing, the request is for a specific device (master or slave), and the device descriptor parameter for the device on whose behalf the batch request is made is required.
  * type `string`: The message type (e.g., INIT_REQ, AVAIL_SPECTRUM_REQ, ...).
  * version `string`: The PAWS version. Must be exactly 1.0.

  * kind `string`: Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "spectrum#pawsGetSpectrumBatchResponse".
  * maxContiguousBwHz `number`: The database may return a constraint on the allowed maximum contiguous bandwidth (in Hertz). A regulatory domain may require the database to return this parameter. When this parameter is present in the response, the device must apply this constraint to its spectrum-selection logic to ensure that no single block of spectrum has bandwidth that exceeds this value.
  * maxTotalBwHz `number`: The database may return a constraint on the allowed maximum total bandwidth (in Hertz), which does not need to be contiguous. A regulatory domain may require the database to return this parameter. When this parameter is present in the available spectrum batch response, the device must apply this constraint to its spectrum-selection logic to ensure that total bandwidth does not exceed this value.
  * needsSpectrumReport `boolean`: For regulatory domains that require a spectrum-usage report from devices, the database must return true for this parameter if the geo-spectrum schedules list is not empty; otherwise, the database should either return false or omit this parameter.

  * maxContiguousBwHz `number`: The database may return a constraint on the allowed maximum contiguous bandwidth (in Hertz). A regulatory domain may require the database to return this parameter. When this parameter is present in the response, the device must apply this constraint to its spectrum-selection logic to ensure that no single block of spectrum has bandwidth that exceeds this value.
  * maxTotalBwHz `number`: The database may return a constraint on the allowed maximum total bandwidth (in Hertz), which need not be contiguous. A regulatory domain may require the database to return this parameter. When this parameter is present in the available spectrum response, the device must apply this constraint to its spectrum-selection logic to ensure that total bandwidth does not exceed this value.
  * needsSpectrumReport `boolean`: For regulatory domains that require a spectrum-usage report from devices, the database must return true for this parameter if the spectrum schedule list is not empty; otherwise, the database will either return false or omit this parameter. If this parameter is present and its value is true, the device must send a spectrum use notify message to the database; otherwise, the device must not send the notification.
  * rulesetInfo [RulesetInfo](#rulesetinfo)
  * spectrumSchedules `array`: The available spectrum response must contain a spectrum schedule list. The list may be empty if spectrum is not available.

  * spectra `array`: A spectrum list is required in the spectrum-use notification. The list specifies the spectrum that the device expects to use, which includes frequency ranges and maximum power levels. The list may be empty if the device decides not to use any of spectrum. For consistency, the psdBandwidthHz value should match that from one of the spectrum elements in the corresponding available spectrum response previously sent to the device by the database. Note that maximum power levels in the spectrum element must be expressed as power spectral density over the specified psdBandwidthHz value. The actual bandwidth to be used (as computed from the start and stop frequencies) may be different from the psdBandwidthHz value. As an example, when regulatory rules express maximum power spectral density in terms of maximum power over any 100 kHz band, then the psdBandwidthHz value should be set to 100 kHz, even though the actual bandwidth used can be 20 kHz.
    * items [SpectrumMessage](#spectrummessage)

  * maxLocationChange `number`: The maximum location change in meters is required in the initialization response, but optional otherwise. When the device changes location by more than this specified distance, it must contact the database to get the available spectrum for the new location.
