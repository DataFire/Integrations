### apigateway.projects.locations.operations.list
Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`. NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.


```js
google_apigateway.apigateway.projects.locations.operations.list({
  "name": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * name **required** `string`: The name of the operation's parent resource.
  * filter `string`: The standard list filter.

#### Output
* output [ApigatewayListOperationsResponse](#apigatewaylistoperationsresponse)

### apigateway.projects.locations.operations.cancel
Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.


```js
google_apigateway.apigateway.projects.locations.operations.cancel({
  "name": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`

## Definitions

### ApigatewayAuditConfig
* ApigatewayAuditConfig `object`: Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs: { "audit_configs": [ { "service": "allServices", "audit_log_configs": [ { "log_type": "DATA_READ", "exempted_members": [ "user:jose@example.com" ] }, { "log_type": "DATA_WRITE" }, { "log_type": "ADMIN_READ" } ] }, { "service": "sampleservice.googleapis.com", "audit_log_configs": [ { "log_type": "DATA_READ" }, { "log_type": "DATA_WRITE", "exempted_members": [ "user:aliya@example.com" ] } ] } ] } For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ logging. It also exempts jose@example.com from DATA_READ logging, and aliya@example.com from DATA_WRITE logging.
  * auditLogConfigs `array`: The configuration for logging of each type of permission.
    * items [ApigatewayAuditLogConfig](#apigatewayauditlogconfig)
  * service `string`: Specifies a service that will be enabled for audit logging. For example, `storage.googleapis.com`, `cloudsql.googleapis.com`. `allServices` is a special value that covers all services.

### ApigatewayAuditLogConfig
* ApigatewayAuditLogConfig `object`: Provides the configuration for logging a type of permissions. Example: { "audit_log_configs": [ { "log_type": "DATA_READ", "exempted_members": [ "user:jose@example.com" ] }, { "log_type": "DATA_WRITE" } ] } This enables 'DATA_READ' and 'DATA_WRITE' logging, while exempting jose@example.com from DATA_READ logging.
  * exemptedMembers `array`: Specifies the identities that do not cause logging for this type of permission. Follows the same format of Binding.members.
    * items `string`
  * logType `string` (values: LOG_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, ADMIN_READ, DATA_WRITE, DATA_READ): The log type that this config enables.

### ApigatewayBinding
* ApigatewayBinding `object`: Associates `members` with a `role`.
  * condition [ApigatewayExpr](#apigatewayexpr)
  * members `array`: Specifies the identities requesting access for a Cloud Platform resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, `google.com` or `example.com`. 
    * items `string`

### ApigatewayCancelOperationRequest
* ApigatewayCancelOperationRequest `object`: The request message for Operations.CancelOperation.

### ApigatewayExpr
* ApigatewayExpr `object`: Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec. Example (Comparison): title: "Summary size limit" description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars" expression: "document.summary.size() < 100" Example (Equality): title: "Requestor is owner" description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner" expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email" Example (Logic): title: "Public documents" description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible" expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'" Example (Data Manipulation): title: "Notification string" description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp." expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)" The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for additional information.
  * description `string`: Optional. Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.
  * expression `string`: Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax.
  * location `string`: Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.
  * title `string`: Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.

### ApigatewayListLocationsResponse
* ApigatewayListLocationsResponse `object`: The response message for Locations.ListLocations.
  * locations `array`: A list of locations that matches the specified filter in the request.
    * items [ApigatewayLocation](#apigatewaylocation)
  * nextPageToken `string`: The standard List next-page token.

### ApigatewayListOperationsResponse
* ApigatewayListOperationsResponse `object`: The response message for Operations.ListOperations.
  * nextPageToken `string`: The standard List next-page token.
  * operations `array`: A list of operations that matches the specified filter in the request.
    * items [ApigatewayOperation](#apigatewayoperation)

### ApigatewayLocation
* ApigatewayLocation `object`: A resource that represents Google Cloud Platform location.
  * displayName `string`: The friendly name for this location, typically a nearby city name. For example, "Tokyo".
  * labels `object`: Cross-service attributes for the location. For example {"cloud.googleapis.com/region": "us-east1"}
  * locationId `string`: The canonical id for this location. For example: `"us-east1"`.
  * metadata `object`: Service-specific metadata. For example the available capacity at the given location.
  * name `string`: Resource name for the location, which may vary between implementations. For example: `"projects/example-project/locations/us-east1"`

### ApigatewayOperation
* ApigatewayOperation `object`: This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  * done `boolean`: If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  * error [ApigatewayStatus](#apigatewaystatus)
  * metadata `object`: Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
  * name `string`: The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  * response `object`: The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

### ApigatewayPolicy
* ApigatewayPolicy `object`: An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  * auditConfigs `array`: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    * items [ApigatewayAuditConfig](#apigatewayauditconfig)
  * bindings `array`: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    * items [ApigatewayBinding](#apigatewaybinding)
  * etag `string`: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  * version `integer`: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

### ApigatewaySetIamPolicyRequest
* ApigatewaySetIamPolicyRequest `object`: Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.
  * policy [ApigatewayPolicy](#apigatewaypolicy)
  * updateMask `string`: OPTIONAL: A FieldMask specifying which fields of the policy to modify. Only the fields in the mask will be modified. If no mask is provided, the following default mask is used: `paths: "bindings, etag"`

### ApigatewayStatus
* ApigatewayStatus `object`: The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
  * code `integer`: The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
  * details `array`: A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
    * items `object`
  * message `string`: A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.

### ApigatewayTestIamPermissionsRequest
* ApigatewayTestIamPermissionsRequest `object`: Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  * permissions `array`: The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more information see [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
    * items `string`

### ApigatewayTestIamPermissionsResponse
* ApigatewayTestIamPermissionsResponse `object`: Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  * permissions `array`: A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is allowed.
    * items `string`

### Empty
* Empty `object`: A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
