## Description

The Digital Linguistics (DLx) REST API

## Actions

### getLanguages
Retrieves all the Languages that the authenticated user or client has permission to access.


```js
digitallinguistics.getLanguages({}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * continuation `string`: The `dlx-continuation` header is used to send a continuation token with the request, when retrieving the next page of results.
  * deleted `boolean`: Setting the `deleted` option to `true` will return results that have been marked for deletion, but not yet deleted from the database. Otherwise requests for a resource marked for deletion will return a 410 error.
  * ifModifiedSince `string`: The `If-Modified-Since` header is used to retrieve only results modified since a given time. The value of this header must be a valid date string.
  * maxItemCount `string`: The `dlx-max-item-count` header is used to limit the number of results to a certain amount at a time (by default all results will be returned). If there are more results to be returned, a continuation token will also be sent in the `dlx-continuation` header.
  * public `string`: Set this parameter to `true` to include all publicly-accessible resources, not just those that the user is listed as an Owner, Contributor, or Viewer for.

#### Output
*Output schema unknown*

### addLanguage
Add a new Language


```js
digitallinguistics.addLanguage({
  "body": {}
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * body **required** `object`

#### Output
*Output schema unknown*

### upsertLanguage
Creates a Language if it does not yet exist (i.e. if the resource does not have an `id` property yet), or replaces the existing Language resource if it does. Note that this replaces the *entire* Language. It is not a partial update.


```js
digitallinguistics.upsertLanguage({
  "body": {}
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * body **required** `object`
  * ifMatch `string`: The `If-Match` header is used with PUT and DELETE requests to check whether you have the most up-to-date version of the resource before updating or deleting it. The value of the `If-Match` header is the ETag (`_etag`) property of the resource. It is recommended that your application use this header whenever possible to avoid data conflicts.

#### Output
*Output schema unknown*

### deleteLanguage
Delete a Language by ID


```js
digitallinguistics.deleteLanguage({
  "languageID": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * languageID **required** `string`: The ID of the Language to perform the operation on
  * ifMatch `string`: The `If-Match` header is used with PUT and DELETE requests to check whether you have the most up-to-date version of the resource before updating or deleting it. The value of the `If-Match` header is the ETag (`_etag`) property of the resource. It is recommended that your application use this header whenever possible to avoid data conflicts.

#### Output
*Output schema unknown*

### getLanguage
Retrieve a Language by ID


```js
digitallinguistics.getLanguage({
  "languageID": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * languageID **required** `string`: The ID of the Language to perform the operation on
  * deleted `boolean`: Setting the `deleted` option to `true` will return results that have been marked for deletion, but not yet deleted from the database. Otherwise requests for a resource marked for deletion will return a 410 error.
  * ifNoneMatch `string`: If `If-None-Match` header is used with GET requests to check whether you already have the most up-to-date version of the resource, and therefore do not need the resource sent again. The value of the `If-None-Match` header is the ETag (`_etag`) property of the resource. It is recommended that your application use this header whenever possible to reduce bandwidth.

#### Output
*Output schema unknown*

### updateLanguage
Performs a partial update the Language whose ID is specified in the URL. If the Language object has an `id` property, is ignored in favor of the ID in the URL.


```js
digitallinguistics.updateLanguage({
  "languageID": "",
  "body": {}
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * languageID **required** `string`: The ID of the Language to perform the operation on
  * body **required** `object`
  * ifMatch `string`: The `If-Match` header is used with PUT and DELETE requests to check whether you have the most up-to-date version of the resource before updating or deleting it. The value of the `If-Match` header is the ETag (`_etag`) property of the resource. It is recommended that your application use this header whenever possible to avoid data conflicts.
