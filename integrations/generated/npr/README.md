## Description

NPR One is a smart application that brings the best of NPR and Member Station programming, newscasts,
podcasts, and stories together to create a new experience for listening. It provides an editor-curated and
localized mobile listening experience based on the content the listener chooses, likes, shares, and enjoys.
The API provides all of the content and customization in a simple, structured way that is easy for application
developers to implement.

## Actions

### oauthCallback
Exchange the code passed to your redirect URI for an access_token


```js
npr.oauthCallback({
  "code": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * code **required** `string`

#### Output
* output `object`
  * access_token `string`
  * refresh_token `string`
  * token_type `string`
  * scope `string`
  * expiration `string`

### oauthRefresh
Exchange a refresh_token for an access_token


```js
npr.oauthRefresh(null, context)
```

#### Input
*This action has no parameters*

#### Output
* output `object`
  * access_token `string`
  * refresh_token `string`
  * token_type `string`
  * scope `string`
  * expiration `string`

### getAuthorizationPage
If the parameters passed to this endpoint are correct, it will redirect to `npr.org/oauth2/login` for the user to complete the sign-in.

Currently acceptable values for `scope` are any combination of the following:
- `identity.readonly` - for read-only access to the Identity Service
- `identity.write` - for write access to the Identity Service
- `listening.readonly` - for read-only access to the Listening Service
- `listening.write` - for write access to the Listening Service
- `localactivation` - for all access to the Local Activation Service

It is generally suggested that you assume that you will need all of the current scopes in order to successfully implement an NPR One application.

If the parameters passed in are NOT correct and the client passed in a valid `redirect_uri` parameter, the request will be redirected to `{{YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}}?error={{ERROR_TYPE}}&message={{ERROR_DESCRIPTION}}`.
If the parameters passed are NOT correct and the client did not pass in a valid `redirect_uri` parameter, this endpoint will return the errors encoded as JSON objects (along with the corresponding HTTP status code -- usually 400).
The latter is intended for development and debugging purposes -- in a real-world situation, errors returned as JSON objects are irretrievable by the client application, and thus passing in a valid `redirect_uri` is critical even for the purpose of capturing errors.

If the user successfully logs in and authorizes the application, the request will be redirected to `{{YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}}?code={{AUTHORIZATION_CODE}}&state={{CSRF_TOKEN}}`

If the user DENIES the application, they will be redirected to `{{YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}}?error=denied&message=The%20user%20has%20denied%20the%20login%20and%20access%20request&state={{CSRF_TOKEN}}`.
This means that if your application flow requires a user to log in in order to proceed, it is up to you to give them the proper messaging explaining that the sign-in must be authorized in order to continue.

Finally, please do not confuse an authorization code with an access token. Once your app has completed this flow, you will still need to call `POST /authorization/v2/token` in order to swap the code for a valid access token.


```js
npr.getAuthorizationPage({
  "client_id": "",
  "redirect_uri": "",
  "response_type": "",
  "scope": "",
  "state": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * client_id **required** `string`: The client's ID
  * redirect_uri **required** `string`: The client's URL to redirect to if the authentication is approved
  * response_type **required** `string` (values: code): The type of response; currently, only `code` is supported
  * scope **required** `string`: A space-separated list of scope(s) requested by the application
  * state **required** `string`: A CSRF token generated by the client, to be roundtripped through the request for added security

#### Output
*Output schema unknown*

### generateDeviceCode
This flow should only be used by clients who cannot show a native webview or do not have advanced input controls. It is an alternative to `GET /authorization/v2/authorize`.

Third-party clients will need to use one or the other of these two endpoints, but they will generally not use both.


```js
npr.generateDeviceCode({
  "client_id": "",
  "client_secret": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * client_id **required** `string`: The client's ID
  * client_secret **required** `string`: The client's secret key
  * scope `string`: A space-separated list of scope(s) requested by the application. Required for all untrusted clients; will be ignored for trusted clients.

#### Output
* output [DeviceCodeData](#devicecodedata)

### createToken
Please be aware that the required parameters are contingent on the `grant_type` that you select.

For the `authorization_code` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters. `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

For the `client_credentials` grant type, you do not need to pass in any additional parameters beyond the basic requirements. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

For the `device_code` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `code` parameter. If you are a third-party developer, you are also required to provide the `scope` parameter; see the documentation for `GET /authorization/v2/authorize` for possible values. `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

For the `password` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `username` and `password` parameters. The `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters are ignored.
Third-party developers do not have access to this grant type.

For the `refresh_token` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `refresh_token` parameter. The `scope` parameter can optionally be used to request a different set of scopes than were used in the original request, but it **cannot** contain any scopes that were not previously requested. If not specified, then `scope` will be set to whichever scopes were used for the original access token request. If trading in an old non-expiring access token for a refresh-enabled token, set the value of `refresh_token` to the access token value and `token_type_hint` must be set to `access_token`. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

The `temporary_user` and `anonymous_user` grant types are custom grant types created by NPR to suit our needs for functionality such as our &quot;try-before-you-buy&quot; experience. If you are a third-party developer, you will not have access to these grant types unless we have explicitly given you permission within our system.
For these grant types, if you are a third-party developer, you are required to provide the `scope` parameter; see the documentation for `GET /authorization/v2/authorize` for possible values. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

The `third_party` grant type is another custom grant type created by NPR to handle login via third-party providers such as Facebook and Google. If you are a third-party developer, you will not have access to this grant types unless we have explicitly given you permission within our system.
For this grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `service` and `token` parameters. If you are a third-party developer, you are also required to provide the `scope` parameter; see the documentation for `GET /authorization/v2/authorize` for possible values. The `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters are ignored.

If you are unsure of which grant type to select, assume that `authorization_code` is the one you want.

Note that at this time, refresh tokens are an opt-in feature; however, in the future, they will gradually transition to being opt-out, and ultimately required for all clients. Our general guidance at this time is that if this endpoint starts returning refresh tokens for you, you are responsible for implementing the code to handle them appropriately in accordance with the OAuth 2.0 spec. For more information about our gradual rollout of this feature, please contact the NPR One API team.


```js

  * client_id **required** `string`: The client's ID, required for all grant types.
  * client_secret **required** `string`: The client's secret, required for all grant types.
  * code `string`: Required for `authorization_code` and `device_code` grant types. The authorization code from a successful call to `/authorization/v2/authorize`, or a device code from a successful call to `/authorization/v2/device`.
  * redirect_uri `string`: Required for `authorization_code` grant type. The requested redirect_uri.
  * username `string`: Required for `password` grant type. The email address of an NPR user.

  * service `string` (values: facebook, google, microsoft, janrain, comcast): Required for `third_party` grant type. The name of the third-party login provider.
  * refresh_token `string`: Required for `refresh_token` grant type. A valid refresh token from a previous successful call to `POST /authorization/v2/token`.
  * scope `string`: Required for third-party developers using the `device_code`, `temporary_user`, and `third_party` grant types. Optionally used by the `refresh_token` grant type. A space-separated list of scope(s) requested by the application.
  * token_type_hint `string` (values: access_token, refresh_token): A hint about the type of the token submitted for a new access and refresh token. If unspecified, the default value is assumed to be `refresh_token`.

#### Output
* output [AccessTokenData](#accesstokendata)

### revokeToken
Our implementation follows the proposed IETF specification [RFC-7009](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009).

If your client application offers the ability to for a logged-in user to log out, and you have access to a long-lived
`client_credentials` token (i.e. you have generated one that you are storing securely for the lifetime of the entire app
install), we suggest (but do not require) that you call this endpoint and revoke the access token belonging to the
logged-in user as part of your logout process. If you do not already have a long-lived `client_credentials` token,
please don't generate one just for the purposes of calling this endpoint.

If you are building a prototype application, we also recommend that you use this endpoint to clean up access tokens
that you generate during the testing of your app and do not intend to reuse.

Note that revoking an access token will automatically revoke any refresh tokens associated with it, and vice-versa.


```js
npr.revokeToken({
  "Authorization": "",
  "token": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * Authorization **required** `string`: A `client_credentials` access token from the same client application as the token being revoked. Should start with `Bearer`, followed by a space, followed by the token.
  * token **required** `string`: The access token or refresh token that the client wants to have revoked.
  * token_type_hint `string` (values: access_token, refresh_token): A hint about the type of the token submitted for revocation. If unspecified, the default value is assumed to be `access_token`.

#### Output
* output `object`: An empty JSON object

### postFollowing

Be sure to copy and send back the entire ratings object (RatingData), as new fields may be added to it in the future.

This endpoint can return a blank JSON.doc or AudioItemDocument depending on the `recommend=true|false` parameter. The `recommend=true` flag allows this endpoint to both receive ratings and send back recommendations in the same call.


```js
npr.postRating({
  "Authorization": "",

### getRecommendations
This endpoint returns a list of audio recommendations. It is designed to be used for an initial list of recommendations, and then `GET /listening/v2/ratings?recommend=true` should be used for subsequent requests for recommendations.

A fully-populated link to the ratings endpoint is returned with each individual recommendation and is located in the AudioItemDocument under the `links['recommendations']` object. The query parameters in this link should not be modified.
Be sure to copy and send back the entire ratings object (RatingData), as new fields may be added to it in the future.


```js
npr.getRecommendations({
  "Authorization": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * Authorization **required** `string`: Your access token from the Authorization Service. Should start with `Bearer`, followed by a space, followed by the token.
  * X-Advertising-ID `string`: A device-specific advertising identifier, if possible. Apple's IDFA is an example.

#### Output
* output [AudioItemListDocument](#audioitemlistdocument)

### getSearchRecommendations
In the schema shown below, SearchItemDocument is not an actual type of returned object; the object returned by a search will be either an AggregationAudioItemListDocument or an AudioItemDocument.


```js
npr.getSearchRecommendations({
  "Authorization": "",
  "searchTerms": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * Authorization **required** `string`: Your access token from the Authorization Service. Should start with `Bearer`, followed by a space, followed by the token.
  * searchTerms **required** `string`: Search terms to search on; can include URL-encoded punctuation

#### Output

### sendDonationEmail
This will send a station-specific donation email to the logged-in user.


```js
npr.sendDonationEmail({
  "Authorization": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * Authorization **required** `string`: Your access token from the Authorization Service. Should start with `Bearer`, followed by a space, followed by the token.

#### Output
* output [CollectionDocument](#collectiondocument)

### getAds
**Not** for use by NPR One clients (for whom sponsorship is already integrated into the Listening Service), this endpoint is designed to be used by our other client applications to request sponsorship on behalf of a user. Sponsorship units are returned in the form of DAAST XML. It is worth noting that this endpoint attempts to always return XML, even in the case of exceptions.

The default behavior of this endpoint is asynchronous; on an initial request, a call to our external sponsorship provider is placed on a queue, which is typically processed within 3 minutes. Once the sponsorship call is received and processed, the returned sponsorship units are placed in a cache on our server for the current user. Subsequent calls to this endpoint will return DAAST sponsorship units from this cache until tracking information is submitted, which removes the ad from the cache and will automatically request additional ads asynchronously if there are fewer than a certain number remaining in the cache.

For development purposes, it's worth noting that there is currently no way to clear a user's cache without submitting some form of tracking.


```js
npr.getAds({
  "Authorization": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * Authorization **required** `string`: Your access token from the Authorization Service. Should start with `Bearer`, followed by a space, followed by the token.
  * X-Advertising-ID `string`: A device-specific advertising identifier, if possible. Apple's IDFA is an example.
  * forceResult `boolean`: Whether to force a synchronous call to our external sponsorship provider; the default behavior is asynchronous.
  * adCount `integer`: How many sponsorship units to request in one call; if left unspecified, the default behavior is to return only 1.

#### Output
* output [DAASTXml](#daastxml)

### receiveAdTracking
**Not** for use by NPR One clients (for whom sponsorship is already integrated into the Listening Service), this endpoint is designed to be used by our other client applications to submit tracking information for sponsorship units obtained from the `GET /sponsorship/v2/ads` endpoint.

The tracking information should be submitted in the body of the request in the form of a JSON object following the Collection.Doc+JSON specification.


```js
npr.receiveAdTracking({
  "Authorization": "",
  "body": null
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * Authorization **required** `string`: Your access token from the Authorization Service. Should start with `Bearer`, followed by a space, followed by the token.
  * X-Advertising-ID `string`: A device-specific advertising identifier, if possible. Apple's IDFA is an example.
  * body **required** [UserAdDocument](#useraddocument)

#### Output
*Output schema unknown*

### searchStations
This endpoint has two main use cases:

- If no query parameters passed in, it returns a list of stations that are geographically closest to the calling client (based on GeoIP information)
- If one or more query parameters are passed in, it performs a search of NPR stations that match those search criteria (not taking into account the client's physical location)

Clients wanting to implement a 'Change Station' UI should use this endpoint to power their search. In most cases, you'll want to build a search interface that uses one of the 3 provided schemas: `lat` and `lon` (using e.g. the HTML5 Geolocation API), `city` and `state`, _or_ the generic `q` query which can accept a station name, call letters, network name, or zip code. Technically speaking, `q` can also take in either a city name or a state name, but using the `city` and `state` parameters together will yield more accurate geographic search results than `q={cityName}`.

The `lat` and `lon` query parameters should always be passed in together (otherwise the API will return a 400 error), and if included in the query, they will take precedence over any other search criteria; that is, `lat` and `lon` will do a purely geographic search and not take into account `q`, `city` or `state`.

Similarly, `city` and/or `state` will take precedence over (and ignore) `q`.

If clients want to be able to offer multiple types of searches (e.g. 'Search for a station name, city or zipcode') using a *single* search input form, `q` should be used. But again, be aware that using `city` and `state` together will yield more accurate search results than `q={cityName}`.


```js
npr.searchStations({
  "Authorization": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * Authorization **required** `string`: Your access token from the Authorization Service. Should start with `Bearer`, followed by a space, followed by the token.
  * q `string`: Search terms to search on; can be a station name, network name, call letters, or zipcode
  * city `string`: A city to look for stations from; intended to be paired with `state`
  * state `string`: A state to look for stations from (using the 2-letter abbreviation); intended to be paired with `city`
  * lat `number`: A latitude value from a geographic coordinate system; only works if paired with `lon`
  * lon `number`: A longitude value from a geographic coordinate system; only works if paired with `lat`

#### Output
* output [StationListDocument](#stationlistdocument)

### getStationById
This endpoint retrieves information about a given station, based on its numeric ID, which is consistent across all of NPR's APIs.

A typical use case for this data is for clients who want to create a dropdown menu, modal/pop-up or dedicated page displaying more information about the station the client is localized to, including, for example, links to the station's homepage and donation (pledge) page.


```js
npr.getStationById({
  "Authorization": "",
  "stationId": 0
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * Authorization **required** `string`: Your access token from the Authorization Service. Should start with `Bearer`, followed by a space, followed by the token.
  * stationId **required** `integer`: The numeric ID of a station

#### Output
* output [StationDocument](#stationdocument)
