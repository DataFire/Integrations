## Definitions

### AcknowledgeRequest
* AcknowledgeRequest `object`: Request for the Acknowledge method.
  * ackIds `array`: The acknowledgment ID for the messages being acknowledged that was returned by the Pub/Sub system in the `Pull` response. Must not be empty.
    * items `string`

### Binding
* Binding `object`: Associates `members` with a `role`.
  * condition [Expr](#expr)
  * members `array`: Specifies the identities requesting access for a Cloud Platform resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`.

For example, `google.com` or `example.com`. 
    * items `string`
  * role `string`: Role that is assigned to `members`. For example, `roles/viewer`, `roles/editor`, or `roles/owner`.

### Empty
* Empty `object`: A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.

### Expr
* Expr `object`: Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec. Example (Comparison): title: "Summary size limit" description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars" expression: "document.summary.size() < 100" Example (Equality): title: "Requestor is owner" description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner" expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email" Example (Logic): title: "Public documents" description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible" expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'" Example (Data Manipulation): title: "Notification string" description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp." expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)" The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for additional information.
  * description `string`: Optional. Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.
  * expression `string`: Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax.
  * location `string`: Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.
  * title `string`: Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.

### ListSubscriptionsResponse

For example, if the value is 10, the new ack deadline will expire 10 seconds after the `ModifyAckDeadline` call was made. Specifying zero may immediately make the message available for another pull request.
  * ackId `string`: The acknowledgment ID. Either this or ack_ids must be populated, but not both.
  * ackIds `array`: List of acknowledgment IDs.
    * items `string`

### ModifyPushConfigRequest

### OidcToken
* OidcToken `object`: Contains information needed for generating an [OpenID Connect token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect).
  * audience `string`: Audience to be used when generating OIDC token. The audience claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. The audience value is a single case-sensitive string. Having multiple values (array) for the audience field is not supported. More info about the OIDC JWT token audience here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3 Note: if not specified, the Push endpoint URL will be used.
  * serviceAccountEmail `string`: [Service account email](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) to be used for generating the OIDC token. The caller (for CreateSubscription, UpdateSubscription, and ModifyPushConfig RPCs) must have the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission for the service account.

### Policy
* Policy `object`: An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  * bindings `array`: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    * items [Binding](#binding)
  * etag `string`: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  * version `integer`: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

### PublishRequest
* PublishRequest `object`: Request for the Publish method.
  * messages `array`: The messages to publish.
    * items [PubsubMessage](#pubsubmessage)

### PublishResponse
* PublishResponse `object`: Response for the `Publish` method.
  * messageIds `array`: The server-assigned ID of each published message, in the same order as the messages in the request. IDs are guaranteed to be unique within the topic.
    * items `string`

### PubsubMessage
* PubsubMessage `object`: A message data and its attributes. The message payload must not be empty; it must contain either a non-empty data field, or at least one attribute.
  * attributes `object`: Optional attributes for this message.
  * data `string`: The message payload. For JSON requests, the value of this field must be [base64-encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648).
  * messageId `string`: ID of this message, assigned by the server when the message is published. Guaranteed to be unique within the topic. This value may be read by a subscriber that receives a `PubsubMessage` via a `Pull` call or a push delivery. It must not be populated by the publisher in a `Publish` call.
  * publishTime `string`: The time at which the message was published, populated by the server when it receives the `Publish` call. It must not be populated by the publisher in a `Publish` call.

### PullRequest
* PullRequest `object`: Request for the `Pull` method.
  * maxMessages `integer`: The maximum number of messages returned for this request. The Pub/Sub system may return fewer than the number specified.
  * returnImmediately `boolean`: Optional. If this is specified as true the system will respond immediately even if it is not able to return a message in the `Pull` response. Otherwise the system is allowed to wait until at least one message is available rather than returning no messages. The client may cancel the request if it does not wish to wait any longer for the response. Warning: setting this field to `true` is discouraged because it adversely impacts the performance of `Pull` operations. We recommend that users do not set this field.

### PullResponse
* PullResponse `object`: Response for the `Pull` method.
  * receivedMessages `array`: Received Pub/Sub messages. The Pub/Sub system will return zero messages if there are no more available in the backlog. The Pub/Sub system may return fewer than the `maxMessages` requested even if there are more messages available in the backlog.
    * items [ReceivedMessage](#receivedmessage)

### PushConfig
* PushConfig `object`: Configuration for a push delivery endpoint.
  * attributes `object`: Endpoint configuration attributes. Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can be used to control different aspects of the message delivery. The currently supported attribute is `x-goog-version`, which you can use to change the format of the push message. This attribute indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the envelope (i.e. its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is based on the version of the Pub/Sub API. If not present during the `CreateSubscription` call, it will default to the version of the API used to make such call. If not present during a `ModifyPushConfig` call, its value will not be changed. `GetSubscription` calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was created without this attribute. The possible values for this attribute are: * `v1beta1`: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API. * `v1` or `v1beta2`: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.
  * oidcToken [OidcToken](#oidctoken)
  * pushEndpoint `string`: A URL locating the endpoint to which messages should be pushed. For example, a Webhook endpoint might use "https://example.com/push".

### ReceivedMessage
* ReceivedMessage `object`: A message and its corresponding acknowledgment ID.
  * ackId `string`: This ID can be used to acknowledge the received message.
  * message [PubsubMessage](#pubsubmessage)

### SetIamPolicyRequest
* SetIamPolicyRequest `object`: Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.
  * policy [Policy](#policy)

### Subscription
* Subscription `object`: A subscription resource.
  * ackDeadlineSeconds `integer`: This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered again during that time (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call `ModifyAckDeadline` with the corresponding `ack_id` if using pull. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message. If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.
  * name `string`: The name of the subscription. It must have the format `"projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}"`. `{subscription}` must start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`), plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters in length, and it must not start with `"goog"`.
  * pushConfig [PushConfig](#pushconfig)
  * topic `string`: The name of the topic from which this subscription is receiving messages. The value of this field will be `_deleted-topic_` if the topic has been deleted.

### TestIamPermissionsRequest
