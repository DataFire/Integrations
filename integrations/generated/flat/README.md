## Description

The Flat API allows you to easily extend the abilities of the [Flat Platform](https://flat.io), with a wide range of use cases including the following:

* Creating and importing new music scores using MusicXML, MIDI, Guitar Pro (GP3, GP4, GP5, GPX, GP), PowerTab, TuxGuitar and MuseScore files
* Browsing, updating, copying, exporting the user's scores (for example in MP3, WAV or MIDI)
* Managing educational resources with Flat for Education: creating & updating the organization accounts, the classes, rosters and assignments.

The Flat API is built on HTTP. Our API is RESTful It has predictable resource URLs. It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors. It also accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.
The [schema](/swagger.yaml) of this API follows the [OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) specification](https://www.openapis.org/), you can use and work with [compatible Swagger tools](http://swagger.io/open-source-integrations/).
This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).

You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Flat's API. This specification and reference is [available on Github](https://github.com/FlatIO/api-reference).

You can add users to this class using `POST /classes/{class}/users/{user}`, they will automatically added to the group based on their role on Flat. Users can also enroll themselves to this class using `POST /classes/enroll/{enrollmentCode}` and the `enrollmentCode` returned in the `ClassDetails` response.

This API call will automatically create the first revision of the document, the score can be modified by the using our web application or by uploading a new revision of this file (`POST /v2/scores/{score}/revisions/{revision}`).

The currently authenticated user will be granted owner of the file and will be able to add other collaborators (users and groups).

If no `collection` is specified, the API will create the score in the most appropriate collection. This can be the `root` collection or a different collection based on the user's settings or API authentication method.
If a `collection` is specified and this one has more public privacy settings than the score (e.g. `public` vs `private` for the score), the privacy settings of the created score will be adjusted to the collection ones.
You can check the adjusted privacy settings in the returned score `privacy`, and optionally adjust these settings if needed using `PUT /scores/{score}`.
