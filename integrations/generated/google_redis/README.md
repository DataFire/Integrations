### redis.projects.locations.operations.list
Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`. NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.


```js
google_redis.redis.projects.locations.operations.list({
  "name": ""
}, context)
```

#### Input
* input `object`
  * name **required** `string`: The name of the operation's parent resource.

### redis.projects.locations.operations.cancel
Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

google_redis.redis.projects.locations.operations.cancel({

### InstanceAuthString
* InstanceAuthString `object`: Instance AUTH string details.
  * authString `string`: AUTH string set on the instance.

### ListInstancesResponse
* ListInstancesResponse `object`: Response for ListInstances.
  * instances `array`: A list of Redis instances in the project in the specified location, or across all locations. If the `location_id` in the parent field of the request is "-", all regions available to the project are queried, and the results aggregated. If in such an aggregated query a location is unavailable, a placeholder Redis entry is included in the response with the `name` field set to a value of the form `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/`- and the `status` field set to ERROR and `status_message` field set to "location not available for ListInstances".
    * items [Instance](#instance)
  * nextPageToken `string`: Token to retrieve the next page of results, or empty if there are no more results in the list.
  * unreachable `array`: Locations that could not be reached.
    * items `string`

### ListLocationsResponse
* ListLocationsResponse `object`: The response message for Locations.ListLocations.
  * locations `array`: A list of locations that matches the specified filter in the request.
    * items [Location](#location)
  * nextPageToken `string`: The standard List next-page token.

### ListOperationsResponse
* ListOperationsResponse `object`: The response message for Operations.ListOperations.
  * nextPageToken `string`: The standard List next-page token.
  * operations `array`: A list of operations that matches the specified filter in the request.
    * items [Operation](#operation)

### Location
* Location `object`: A resource that represents Google Cloud Platform location.
  * displayName `string`: The friendly name for this location, typically a nearby city name. For example, "Tokyo".
  * labels `object`: Cross-service attributes for the location. For example {"cloud.googleapis.com/region": "us-east1"}
  * locationId `string`: Resource ID for the region. For example: "us-east1".
  * metadata `object`: Output only. The set of available zones in the location. The map is keyed by the lowercase ID of each zone, as defined by Compute Engine. These keys can be specified in `location_id` or `alternative_location_id` fields when creating a Redis instance.
  * name `string`: Full resource name for the region. For example: "projects/example-project/locations/us-east1".

### Operation
* Operation `object`: This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  * done `boolean`: If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  * error [Status](#status)
  * metadata `object`: { `createTime`: The time the operation was created. `endTime`: The time the operation finished running. `target`: Server-defined resource path for the target of the operation. `verb`: Name of the verb executed by the operation. `statusDetail`: Human-readable status of the operation, if any. `cancelRequested`: Identifies whether the user has requested cancellation of the operation. Operations that have successfully been cancelled have Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`. `apiVersion`: API version used to start the operation. }
  * name `string`: The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  * response `object`: The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

### OutputConfig
* OutputConfig `object`: The output content
  * gcsDestination [GcsDestination](#gcsdestination)

### Status
* Status `object`: The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
  * code `integer`: The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
  * details `array`: A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
    * items `object`
  * message `string`: A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.

### TlsCertificate
* TlsCertificate `object`: TlsCertificate Resource
  * cert `string`: PEM representation.
  * createTime `string`: Output only. The time when the certificate was created in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format, for example `2020-05-18T00:00:00.094Z`.
  * expireTime `string`: Output only. The time when the certificate expires in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format, for example `2020-05-18T00:00:00.094Z`.
  * serialNumber `string`: Serial number, as extracted from the certificate.
  * sha1Fingerprint `string`: Sha1 Fingerprint of the certificate.

### UpgradeInstanceRequest
* UpgradeInstanceRequest `object`: Request for UpgradeInstance.
  * redisVersion `string`: Required. Specifies the target version of Redis software to upgrade to.
