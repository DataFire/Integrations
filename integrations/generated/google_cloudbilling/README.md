#### Output
* output [ProjectBillingInfo](#projectbillinginfo)

### cloudbilling.projects.updateBillingInfo
Sets or updates the billing account associated with a project. You specify the new billing account by setting the `billing_account_name` in the `ProjectBillingInfo` resource to the resource name of a billing account. Associating a project with an open billing account enables billing on the project and allows charges for resource usage. If the project already had a billing account, this method changes the billing account used for resource usage charges. *Note:* Incurred charges that have not yet been reported in the transaction history of the Google Cloud Console might be billed to the new billing account, even if the charge occurred before the new billing account was assigned to the project. The current authenticated user must have ownership privileges for both the [project](https://cloud.google.com/docs/permissions-overview#h.bgs0oxofvnoo ) and the [billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access). You can disable billing on the project by setting the `billing_account_name` field to empty. This action disassociates the current billing account from the project. Any billable activity of your in-use services will stop, and your application could stop functioning as expected. Any unbilled charges to date will be billed to the previously associated account. The current authenticated user must be either an owner of the project or an owner of the billing account for the project. Note that associating a project with a *closed* billing account will have much the same effect as disabling billing on the project: any paid resources used by the project will be shut down. Thus, unless you wish to disable billing, you should always call this method with the name of an *open* billing account.

## Definitions

### AggregationInfo
* AggregationInfo `object`: Represents the aggregation level and interval for pricing of a single SKU.
  * aggregationCount `integer`: The number of intervals to aggregate over. Example: If aggregation_level is "DAILY" and aggregation_count is 14, aggregation will be over 14 days.
  * aggregationInterval `string` (values: AGGREGATION_INTERVAL_UNSPECIFIED, DAILY, MONTHLY)
  * aggregationLevel `string` (values: AGGREGATION_LEVEL_UNSPECIFIED, ACCOUNT, PROJECT)

### AuditConfig
* AuditConfig `object`: Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs: { "audit_configs": [ { "service": "allServices", "audit_log_configs": [ { "log_type": "DATA_READ", "exempted_members": [ "user:jose@example.com" ] }, { "log_type": "DATA_WRITE" }, { "log_type": "ADMIN_READ" } ] }, { "service": "sampleservice.googleapis.com", "audit_log_configs": [ { "log_type": "DATA_READ" }, { "log_type": "DATA_WRITE", "exempted_members": [ "user:aliya@example.com" ] } ] } ] } For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ logging. It also exempts jose@example.com from DATA_READ logging, and aliya@example.com from DATA_WRITE logging.
  * auditLogConfigs `array`: The configuration for logging of each type of permission.
    * items [AuditLogConfig](#auditlogconfig)
  * service `string`: Specifies a service that will be enabled for audit logging. For example, `storage.googleapis.com`, `cloudsql.googleapis.com`. `allServices` is a special value that covers all services.

### AuditLogConfig
* AuditLogConfig `object`: Provides the configuration for logging a type of permissions. Example: { "audit_log_configs": [ { "log_type": "DATA_READ", "exempted_members": [ "user:jose@example.com" ] }, { "log_type": "DATA_WRITE" } ] } This enables 'DATA_READ' and 'DATA_WRITE' logging, while exempting jose@example.com from DATA_READ logging.
  * exemptedMembers `array`: Specifies the identities that do not cause logging for this type of permission. Follows the same format of Binding.members.
    * items `string`
  * logType `string` (values: LOG_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, ADMIN_READ, DATA_WRITE, DATA_READ): The log type that this config enables.

### BillingAccount
* BillingAccount `object`: A billing account in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). You can assign a billing account to one or more projects.
  * displayName `string`: The display name given to the billing account, such as `My Billing Account`. This name is displayed in the Google Cloud Console.
  * masterBillingAccount `string`: If this account is a [subaccount](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts), then this will be the resource name of the master billing account that it is being resold through. Otherwise this will be empty.
  * name `string`: Output only. The resource name of the billing account. The resource name has the form `billingAccounts/{billing_account_id}`. For example, `billingAccounts/012345-567890-ABCDEF` would be the resource name for billing account `012345-567890-ABCDEF`.
  * open `boolean`: Output only. True if the billing account is open, and will therefore be charged for any usage on associated projects. False if the billing account is closed, and therefore projects associated with it will be unable to use paid services.

### Binding
* Binding `object`: Associates `members` with a `role`.
  * condition [Expr](#expr)
  * members `array`: Specifies the identities requesting access for a Cloud Platform resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted.

If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`.

For example, `google.com` or `example.com`. 
    * items `string`
  * role `string`: Role that is assigned to `members`. For example, `roles/viewer`, `roles/editor`, or `roles/owner`.

  * units `string`: The whole units of the amount. For example if `currencyCode` is `"USD"`, then 1 unit is one US dollar.

### Policy
* Policy `object`: An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  * auditConfigs `array`: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    * items [AuditConfig](#auditconfig)
  * bindings `array`: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    * items [Binding](#binding)
  * etag `string`: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  * version `integer`: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

### PricingExpression
* PricingExpression `object`: Expresses a mathematical pricing formula. For Example:- `usage_unit: GBy` `tiered_rates:` `[start_usage_amount: 20, unit_price: $10]` `[start_usage_amount: 100, unit_price: $5]` The above expresses a pricing formula where the first 20GB is free, the next 80GB is priced at $10 per GB followed by $5 per GB for additional usage.
  * baseUnit `string`: The base unit for the SKU which is the unit used in usage exports. Example: "By"
  * baseUnitConversionFactor `number`: Conversion factor for converting from price per usage_unit to price per base_unit, and start_usage_amount to start_usage_amount in base_unit. unit_price / base_unit_conversion_factor = price per base_unit. start_usage_amount * base_unit_conversion_factor = start_usage_amount in base_unit.
  * baseUnitDescription `string`: The base unit in human readable form. Example: "byte".
  * displayQuantity `number`: The recommended quantity of units for displaying pricing info. When displaying pricing info it is recommended to display: (unit_price * display_quantity) per display_quantity usage_unit. This field does not affect the pricing formula and is for display purposes only. Example: If the unit_price is "0.0001 USD", the usage_unit is "GB" and the display_quantity is "1000" then the recommended way of displaying the pricing info is "0.10 USD per 1000 GB"
  * tieredRates `array`: The list of tiered rates for this pricing. The total cost is computed by applying each of the tiered rates on usage. This repeated list is sorted by ascending order of start_usage_amount.
    * items [TierRate](#tierrate)
