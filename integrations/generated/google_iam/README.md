### iam.projects.serviceAccounts.disable
Disables a ServiceAccount immediately. If an application uses the service account to authenticate, that application can no longer call Google APIs or access Google Cloud resources. Existing access tokens for the service account are rejected, and requests for new access tokens will fail. To re-enable the service account, use EnableServiceAccount. After you re-enable the service account, its existing access tokens will be accepted, and you can request new access tokens. To help avoid unplanned outages, we recommend that you disable the service account before you delete it. Use this method to disable the service account, then wait at least 24 hours and watch for unintended consequences. If there are no unintended consequences, you can delete the service account with DeleteServiceAccount.

### iam.projects.serviceAccounts.getIamPolicy
Gets the IAM policy that is attached to a ServiceAccount. This IAM policy specifies which members have access to the service account. This method does not tell you whether the service account has been granted any roles on other resources. To check whether a service account has role grants on a resource, use the `getIamPolicy` method for that resource. For example, to view the role grants for a project, call the Resource Manager API's [`projects.getIamPolicy`](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/getIamPolicy) method.

### iam.projects.serviceAccounts.setIamPolicy
Sets the IAM policy that is attached to a ServiceAccount. Use this method to grant or revoke access to the service account. For example, you could grant a member the ability to impersonate the service account. This method does not enable the service account to access other resources. To grant roles to a service account on a resource, follow these steps: 1. Call the resource's `getIamPolicy` method to get its current IAM policy. 2. Edit the policy so that it binds the service account to an IAM role for the resource. 3. Call the resource's `setIamPolicy` method to update its IAM policy. For detailed instructions, see [Granting roles to a service account for specific resources](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/service-accounts/granting-access-to-service-accounts).

### AdminAuditData
* AdminAuditData `object`: Audit log information specific to Cloud IAM admin APIs. This message is serialized as an `Any` type in the `ServiceData` message of an `AuditLog` message.
  * permissionDelta [PermissionDelta](#permissiondelta)

### AuditConfig
* AuditConfig `object`: Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs: { "audit_configs": [ { "service": "allServices", "audit_log_configs": [ { "log_type": "DATA_READ", "exempted_members": [ "user:jose@example.com" ] }, { "log_type": "DATA_WRITE" }, { "log_type": "ADMIN_READ" } ] }, { "service": "sampleservice.googleapis.com", "audit_log_configs": [ { "log_type": "DATA_READ" }, { "log_type": "DATA_WRITE", "exempted_members": [ "user:aliya@example.com" ] } ] } ] } For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ logging. It also exempts jose@example.com from DATA_READ logging, and aliya@example.com from DATA_WRITE logging.
  * auditLogConfigs `array`: The configuration for logging of each type of permission.
    * items [AuditLogConfig](#auditlogconfig)

### Operation
* Operation `object`: This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  * done `boolean`: If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  * error [Status](#status)
  * metadata `object`: Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
  * name `string`: The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  * response `object`: The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

### PatchServiceAccountRequest
* PatchServiceAccountRequest `object`: The request for PatchServiceAccount. You can patch only the `display_name` and `description` fields. You must use the `update_mask` field to specify which of these fields you want to patch. Only the fields specified in the request are guaranteed to be returned in the response. Other fields may be empty in the response.

### Policy
* Policy `object`: An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  * auditConfigs `array`: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    * items [AuditConfig](#auditconfig)
  * bindings `array`: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    * items [Binding](#binding)
  * etag `string`: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  * version `integer`: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

  * includedPermissions `array`: The names of the permissions this role grants when bound in an IAM policy.
    * items `string`
  * name `string`: The name of the role. When Role is used in CreateRole, the role name must not be set. When Role is used in output and other input such as UpdateRole, the role name is the complete path, e.g., roles/logging.viewer for predefined roles and organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles/logging.viewer for custom roles.
  * stage `string` (values: ALPHA, BETA, GA, DEPRECATED, DISABLED, EAP): The current launch stage of the role. If the `ALPHA` launch stage has been selected for a role, the `stage` field will not be included in the returned definition for the role.
  * title `string`: Optional. A human-readable title for the role. Typically this is limited to 100 UTF-8 bytes.

### ServiceAccount
* ServiceAccount `object`: An IAM service account. A service account is an account for an application or a virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person. You can use a service account to call Google APIs. To learn more, read the [overview of service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/service-accounts/overview). When you create a service account, you specify the project ID that owns the service account, as well as a name that must be unique within the project. IAM uses these values to create an email address that identifies the service account.
  * description `string`: Optional. A user-specified, human-readable description of the service account. The maximum length is 256 UTF-8 bytes.
  * disabled `boolean`: Output only. Whether the service account is disabled.
  * displayName `string`: Optional. A user-specified, human-readable name for the service account. The maximum length is 100 UTF-8 bytes.
  * email `string`: Output only. The email address of the service account.
  * etag `string`: Deprecated. Do not use.
  * name `string`: The resource name of the service account. Use one of the following formats: * `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}` * `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{UNIQUE_ID}` As an alternative, you can use the `-` wildcard character instead of the project ID: * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}` * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{UNIQUE_ID}` When possible, avoid using the `-` wildcard character, because it can cause response messages to contain misleading error codes. For example, if you try to get the service account `projects/-/serviceAccounts/fake@example.com`, which does not exist, the response contains an HTTP `403 Forbidden` error instead of a `404 Not Found` error.
  * oauth2ClientId `string`: Output only. The OAuth 2.0 client ID for the service account.
  * projectId `string`: Output only. The ID of the project that owns the service account.
  * uniqueId `string`: Output only. The unique, stable numeric ID for the service account. Each service account retains its unique ID even if you delete the service account. For example, if you delete a service account, then create a new service account with the same name, the new service account has a different unique ID than the deleted service account.

### ServiceAccountKey
* ServiceAccountKey `object`: Represents a service account key. A service account has two sets of key-pairs: user-managed, and system-managed. User-managed key-pairs can be created and deleted by users. Users are responsible for rotating these keys periodically to ensure security of their service accounts. Users retain the private key of these key-pairs, and Google retains ONLY the public key. System-managed keys are automatically rotated by Google, and are used for signing for a maximum of two weeks. The rotation process is probabilistic, and usage of the new key will gradually ramp up and down over the key's lifetime. If you cache the public key set for a service account, we recommend that you update the cache every 15 minutes. User-managed keys can be added and removed at any time, so it is important to update the cache frequently. For Google-managed keys, Google will publish a key at least 6 hours before it is first used for signing and will keep publishing it for at least 6 hours after it was last used for signing. Public keys for all service accounts are also published at the OAuth2 Service Account API.
  * keyAlgorithm `string` (values: KEY_ALG_UNSPECIFIED, KEY_ALG_RSA_1024, KEY_ALG_RSA_2048): Specifies the algorithm (and possibly key size) for the key.
  * keyOrigin `string` (values: ORIGIN_UNSPECIFIED, USER_PROVIDED, GOOGLE_PROVIDED): The key origin.
  * keyType `string` (values: KEY_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, USER_MANAGED, SYSTEM_MANAGED): The key type.
  * name `string`: The resource name of the service account key in the following format `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}/keys/{key}`.
  * privateKeyData `string`: The private key data. Only provided in `CreateServiceAccountKey` responses. Make sure to keep the private key data secure because it allows for the assertion of the service account identity. When base64 decoded, the private key data can be used to authenticate with Google API client libraries and with gcloud auth activate-service-account.
  * privateKeyType `string` (values: TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, TYPE_PKCS12_FILE, TYPE_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE): The output format for the private key. Only provided in `CreateServiceAccountKey` responses, not in `GetServiceAccountKey` or `ListServiceAccountKey` responses. Google never exposes system-managed private keys, and never retains user-managed private keys.
  * publicKeyData `string`: The public key data. Only provided in `GetServiceAccountKey` responses.
  * validAfterTime `string`: The key can be used after this timestamp.
  * validBeforeTime `string`: The key can be used before this timestamp. For system-managed key pairs, this timestamp is the end time for the private key signing operation. The public key could still be used for verification for a few hours after this time.

### Status
* Status `object`: The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
