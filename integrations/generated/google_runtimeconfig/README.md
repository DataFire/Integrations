# @datafire/google_runtimeconfig

Client library for Cloud Runtime Configuration API

## Installation and Usage
```bash
npm install --save @datafire/google_runtimeconfig
```
```js
let google_runtimeconfig = require('@datafire/google_runtimeconfig').create({
  access_token: "",
  refresh_token: "",
  client_id: "",
  client_secret: "",
  redirect_uri: ""
});

.then(data => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

## Description

The Runtime Configurator allows you to dynamically configure and expose variables through Google Cloud Platform. In addition, you can also set Watchers and Waiters that will watch for changes to your data and return based on certain conditions.

## Definitions

### Binding
* Binding `object`: Associates `members` with a `role`.
  * condition [Expr](#expr)
  * members `array`: Specifies the identities requesting access for a Cloud Platform resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, `google.com` or `example.com`. 
    * items `string`
  * role `string`: Role that is assigned to `members`. For example, `roles/viewer`, `roles/editor`, or `roles/owner`.

### Cardinality
* Cardinality `object`: A Cardinality condition for the Waiter resource. A cardinality condition is met when the number of variables under a specified path prefix reaches a predefined number. For example, if you set a Cardinality condition where the `path` is set to `/foo` and the number of paths is set to `2`, the following variables would meet the condition in a RuntimeConfig resource: + `/foo/variable1 = "value1"` + `/foo/variable2 = "value2"` + `/bar/variable3 = "value3"` It would not satisfy the same condition with the `number` set to `3`, however, because there is only 2 paths that start with `/foo`. Cardinality conditions are recursive; all subtrees under the specific path prefix are counted.
  * number `integer`: The number variables under the `path` that must exist to meet this condition. Defaults to 1 if not specified.
  * path `string`: The root of the variable subtree to monitor. For example, `/foo`.

### Empty
* Empty `object`: A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.

### EndCondition
* EndCondition `object`: The condition that a Waiter resource is waiting for.
  * cardinality [Cardinality](#cardinality)

### Expr
* Expr `object`: Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec. Example (Comparison): title: "Summary size limit" description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars" expression: "document.summary.size() < 100" Example (Equality): title: "Requestor is owner" description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner" expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email" Example (Logic): title: "Public documents" description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible" expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'" Example (Data Manipulation): title: "Notification string" description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp." expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)" The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for additional information.
  * description `string`: Optional. Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.
  * expression `string`: Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax.
  * location `string`: Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.
  * title `string`: Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.

* ListConfigsResponse `object`: `ListConfigs()` returns the following response. The order of returned objects is arbitrary; that is, it is not ordered in any particular way.
  * configs `array`: A list of the configurations in the project. The order of returned objects is arbitrary; that is, it is not ordered in any particular way.
    * items [RuntimeConfig](#runtimeconfig)
  * nextPageToken `string`: This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than `pageSize`, use the `nextPageToken` as a value for the query parameter `pageToken` in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own `nextPageToken` to continue paging through the results

### ListVariablesResponse
* ListVariablesResponse `object`: Response for the `ListVariables()` method.
  * nextPageToken `string`: This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than `pageSize`, use the `nextPageToken` as a value for the query parameter `pageToken` in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own `nextPageToken` to continue paging through the results
  * variables `array`: A list of variables and their values. The order of returned variable objects is arbitrary.
    * items [Variable](#variable)

### ListWaitersResponse
* ListWaitersResponse `object`: Response for the `ListWaiters()` method. Order of returned waiter objects is arbitrary.
  * nextPageToken `string`: This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than `pageSize`, use the `nextPageToken` as a value for the query parameter `pageToken` in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own `nextPageToken` to continue paging through the results
  * waiters `array`: Found waiters in the project.
    * items [Waiter](#waiter)

### Operation
* Operation `object`: This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  * done `boolean`: If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  * error [Status](#status)
  * metadata `object`: Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
  * name `string`: The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  * response `object`: The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

### Policy
* Policy `object`: An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  * bindings `array`: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    * items [Binding](#binding)
  * etag `string`: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  * version `integer`: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

### RuntimeConfig
* RuntimeConfig `object`: A RuntimeConfig resource is the primary resource in the Cloud RuntimeConfig service. A RuntimeConfig resource consists of metadata and a hierarchy of variables.
  * description `string`: An optional description of the RuntimeConfig object.
  * name `string`: The resource name of a runtime config. The name must have the format: projects/[PROJECT_ID]/configs/[CONFIG_NAME] The `[PROJECT_ID]` must be a valid project ID, and `[CONFIG_NAME]` is an arbitrary name that matches the `[0-9A-Za-z](?:[_.A-Za-z0-9-]{0,62}[_.A-Za-z0-9])?` regular expression. The length of `[CONFIG_NAME]` must be less than 64 characters. You pick the RuntimeConfig resource name, but the server will validate that the name adheres to this format. After you create the resource, you cannot change the resource's name.

### SetIamPolicyRequest
* SetIamPolicyRequest `object`: Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.
  * policy [Policy](#policy)

### Status
* Status `object`: The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
  * code `integer`: The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
  * details `array`: A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
    * items `object`
  * message `string`: A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.

### TestIamPermissionsRequest
* TestIamPermissionsRequest `object`: Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  * permissions `array`: The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more information see [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
    * items `string`

### TestIamPermissionsResponse
* TestIamPermissionsResponse `object`: Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  * permissions `array`: A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is allowed.
    * items `string`

### Variable
* Variable `object`: Describes a single variable within a RuntimeConfig resource. The name denotes the hierarchical variable name. For example, `ports/serving_port` is a valid variable name. The variable value is an opaque string and only leaf variables can have values (that is, variables that do not have any child variables).
  * name `string`: The name of the variable resource, in the format: projects/[PROJECT_ID]/configs/[CONFIG_NAME]/variables/[VARIABLE_NAME] The `[PROJECT_ID]` must be a valid project ID, `[CONFIG_NAME]` must be a valid RuntimeConfig resource and `[VARIABLE_NAME]` follows Unix file system file path naming. The `[VARIABLE_NAME]` can contain ASCII letters, numbers, slashes and dashes. Slashes are used as path element separators and are not part of the `[VARIABLE_NAME]` itself, so `[VARIABLE_NAME]` must contain at least one non-slash character. Multiple slashes are coalesced into single slash character. Each path segment should match [0-9A-Za-z](?:[_.A-Za-z0-9-]{0,62}[_.A-Za-z0-9])? regular expression. The length of a `[VARIABLE_NAME]` must be less than 256 characters. Once you create a variable, you cannot change the variable name.
  * state `string` (values: VARIABLE_STATE_UNSPECIFIED, UPDATED, DELETED): Output only. The current state of the variable. The variable state indicates the outcome of the `variables().watch` call and is visible through the `get` and `list` calls.
  * text `string`: The string value of the variable. The length of the value must be less than 4096 bytes. Empty values are also accepted. For example, `text: "my text value"`. The string must be valid UTF-8.
  * updateTime `string`: Output only. The time of the last variable update. Timestamp will be UTC timestamp.
  * value `string`: The binary value of the variable. The length of the value must be less than 4096 bytes. Empty values are also accepted. The value must be base64 encoded, and must comply with IETF RFC4648 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4648.txt). Only one of `value` or `text` can be set.

### Waiter
* Waiter `object`: A Waiter resource waits for some end condition within a RuntimeConfig resource to be met before it returns. For example, assume you have a distributed system where each node writes to a Variable resource indicating the node's readiness as part of the startup process. You then configure a Waiter resource with the success condition set to wait until some number of nodes have checked in. Afterwards, your application runs some arbitrary code after the condition has been met and the waiter returns successfully. Once created, a Waiter resource is immutable. To learn more about using waiters, read the [Creating a Waiter](/deployment-manager/runtime-configurator/creating-a-waiter) documentation.
  * createTime `string`: Output only. The instant at which this Waiter resource was created. Adding the value of `timeout` to this instant yields the timeout deadline for the waiter.
  * done `boolean`: Output only. If the value is `false`, it means the waiter is still waiting for one of its conditions to be met. If true, the waiter has finished. If the waiter finished due to a timeout or failure, `error` will be set.
  * error [Status](#status)
  * failure [EndCondition](#endcondition)
  * name `string`: The name of the Waiter resource, in the format: projects/[PROJECT_ID]/configs/[CONFIG_NAME]/waiters/[WAITER_NAME] The `[PROJECT_ID]` must be a valid Google Cloud project ID, the `[CONFIG_NAME]` must be a valid RuntimeConfig resource, the `[WAITER_NAME]` must match RFC 1035 segment specification, and the length of `[WAITER_NAME]` must be less than 64 bytes. After you create a Waiter resource, you cannot change the resource name.
  * success [EndCondition](#endcondition)
  * timeout `string`: [Required] Specifies the timeout of the waiter in seconds, beginning from the instant that `waiters().create` method is called. If this time elapses before the success or failure conditions are met, the waiter fails and sets the `error` code to `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`.

### WatchVariableRequest
* WatchVariableRequest `object`: Request for the `WatchVariable()` method.
  * newerThan `string`: If specified, checks the current timestamp of the variable and if the current timestamp is newer than `newerThan` timestamp, the method returns immediately. If not specified or the variable has an older timestamp, the watcher waits for a the value to change before returning.
